Stop by the tourist office, pick up your \""Playful Bakar\"" brochure and start exploring. There are three thematic walking tours to choose from. All tours are guided by characters from Bakar's past. For example, join Ana Katarina Zrinska, nee Frankopan, on a pleasant walk to Bakar Castle called \""With Katarina to the Top.\"" If you are interested in the era of development of new ideas and science, join the famous Andrija Mohorovičić on a tour called \""By the Sea with Andro.\"" Finally, one of the first Bakar tourist guides, the blind water carrier Ivan Čop, will reveal the connection between nature and the town in his \""Invisible Bakar of Blind Ivo\"" tour. Each guide has prepared puzzles and brain teasers that turn a tour of Bakar into a game and a challenge for both young and old. The puzzles are not easy and will intrigue you regardless of age. In fact, it is desirable for younger players to have the help of older ones. In other words, fun for the whole family is guaranteed. The solutions themselves are also quite puzzling. You won't know exactly what they mean until you earn rewards. If you successfully solve all the puzzles in all tours and decipher the secret code, you will come to the final solution. It will take you to the deepest Bakar past, older than all our guides. It is not an easy feat, so we have prepared some bonus challenges. Collect photos that show you've completed at least three bonus challenges, and we'll be happy to help you find the final solution. For any help, contact us at the tourist office or at info@tz-bakar.hr. Don't forget to post photos of the walks on social media, tagging the Tourist Board of the Town of Bakar with the hashtags #zaigranibakar, #discoverbakar, and #visitbakar. As you travel through Kvarner and Gorski Kotar, you may have noticed that many locations are marked with distinctive red signs. All such sites are part of a large thematic tour called \""Routes of the Frankopans.\"" It includes places throughout the Primorje-Gorski kotar County significant for the history of the Frankopan family, originating from this region. The Routes of the Frankopans will take you to the Bakar region as well. For example, the already mentioned promenade from Hreljin to Hreljinska Gradina has an additional attraction - the possibility of a gamified tour called the \""Frankopan Adventure.\"" As you walk along the Alley of the Greats, pay attention to the puzzles on the interpretive panels along the promenade. Each panel contains a puzzle, while at the end of the path there is an interesting final solution. Discover it the first chance you get! Of course, the Frankopan heritage in Bakar is also preserved by the old Bakar Castle. A small, but very interesting interpretation center awaits you there.

The valleys are greener, the traditional kulen even more delicious, and the girls have the prettiest smiles. The Slavonian treasure chest will surprise you wherever you go. Gatherings of Stanari\"" (Stanarski susreti) End of August (beginning of September) is reserve for the „Gatherings of Stanari\"" („Stanarski susreti\""). It's an event reviving sweet memories of life on traditional farms called \""stanovi\"". You surely wonder what does term \""stan\"" mean in the village of Babina Greda? It was a name for the house that was in a field close to a forest where local people would live through winter season and was like a second home. In addition to „stan\"", there were other buildings where cattle was kept. Stan was always a few miles from the village. Visitors enjoy competition in disciplines connected to various farming skills, as well as the art preparing old dishes. When you get tired of woodwork, harnessing and shooting pumpkins, the aromas will lead you to a row of old wood stoves. There you will find hand-working local women who prepare all the food you have craved for years, but did not have an opportunity to taste.

This combination of blue and green, sea and mountains, makes us an ideal and easily accessible destination for all those who like to combine cultural and active tourism. While an impressive cultural heritage awaits you in Bakar itself (Frankopan Castle, St. Andrew's Church, Turkish House, Roman House, romantic old streets, coastal promenade, etc.), the surroundings invite you to discover it on foot or by bike! „Must visit\"" spots around are Hreljin Castle („Hreljinskagradina\"") and its beautiful vista, Ponikve area, famous for its „now you see me, now you don't\"" karstic lake, the even more famous BakarskePrezidi vineyards, carved in the steep slopes of the Bakar Bay. Last but not least, you don't want to miss the Risnjak peak which is also located within the Bakar administrative area. That Bakar knows how to develop prime tourism facilities is best evidenced by the numerous awards and recognitions the destination has received for various projects in recent years.

Built on the site where a church had existed since the 12th century, this monumental building received its present form at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries. At that time, it was the third largest church in Croatia! During the Ottoman invasions, it was the seat of the exiled bishops of Modruš, which is why the church has retained the status of a co-cathedral. Because of its acoustics, today this three-nave basilica with as many as nine altars is the favorite place of classical music performers. The Church of St. Andrew hides one more curiosity. There's an underground crypt beneath it! Also known as the \""catacombs,\"" it has two corridors and eighty five graves in which priest and notable Bakar townspeople are buried. The crypt arouses curiosity not only in tourists, but also in archaeologists, historians, and other experts. The crypt hasn't been thoroughly researched, and it is possible it conceals unknown secrets from Bakar's past.  You can visit the crypt as part of  a guided tour of the town. For all information please contact info@tz-bakar.hr. Top 5 activities Climbing the winding streets of Bakar to the sleepy Frankopan Castle, you will feel the spirit of the past at every step.

Top 5 outdoor As we have already mentioned, the highest peak of Risnjak Mountain, one of the most beautiful national parks in Croatia, is located at the far northeastern point of the the town area. The 1,528-meter climb starts above Gornje Jelenje and takes about two hours. This experience is, as you might have guessed, unforgettable, and the view is well worth the effort. Tuhobić Mountain is also a wonderful sight, ideal for hikers and recreationists. The climb to its 1,109-meter high peak starts at the Plase railway station, located between Hreljin and Zlobin, or at Satničko, a popular picnic area. The village of Praputnjak, whose inhabitants are responsible for the creation, and in the 21st century for the restoration of the famous Bakarske Prezidi, is located in the Bakar hinterland. It found itself in its present location around 1730, since the newly constructed Karolina Road passed through it. With the arrival of the trade route, the settlement, which until then had consisted of a number of hamlets scattered around the fertile karst valley called Dolčina, clustered near the road and began to provide various services in addition to agriculture.

Proudly rising above the sea, the castle has witnessed centuries of historical turmoil, keeping a watchful eye over its town. Throughout the past, it was owned by the famous noble families Frankopan and Zrinski, while today it lives a new life sparking historical curiosity in new generations. Although located in the middle of an ancient Mediterranean town, this fascinating building, as its name suggests, was built in the Oriental style. It is believed to have been built in the 14th or the 15th century, but it remains unknown who built it and why. In the absence of historical facts about this site, let us highlight one of the many legends associated with it. According to the legend, Turkish House owes its Oriental look to love.

We start on Saturday, January 11, in Zlobin, followed by Hreljin on January 18, Kukuljanovo on January 25, Škrljevo on February 1, Bakar on February 8, Krasica on February 15, Praputnjak on February 22, and once again in Hreljin on March 1. In addition to the dances and celebrations, the Bakar Bay and the entire hinterland will enjoy many other carnival happenings. Among them, several children's carnivals stand out: January 18 in Kukuljanovo, January 19 in Bakar, February 1 in Škrljevo, February 2 in Krasica, and February 9 in Hreljin. \""Bells and Song for the Bakar Region\"" Perhaps the most eagerly awaited event will be the bell-ringers' gathering, which has been held for over a decade on Kukuljanovo under the name \""Bells and Song for the Bakar Region.\"" This year, it is scheduled for Saturday, January 25, with the main procession starting at 2:00 PM. It will be a fitting climax to the dedication of the Bakar carnival to showcasing the rich carnival heritage and preserving the carnival events of this area. The traditional burning of the \""mesopust\"" will take place on Fat Tuesday, March 4, in Bakar, Hreljin, Kukuljanovo, and Škrljevo.

The vision of the county's development has been encompassed in a study purposely made so that Bale does not develop uncontrollably in the future. The aim of its inhabitants is for the entire town to function as a hotel in the future. There will be a reception at the town's entrance. Its fabulous white stone streets will be the hotel's halls. The legendary Casanova used to walk these magnificent streets. It has recently been discovered that he had visited Bale on two occasions, in 1743 and 1744 to see a young lady from the Soardo family. He surely felt the beauty and the charm of this ancient town. Bale is getting ready to become a town hotel for real.

The castle was built at the beginning of the 16th century as a representable residential palace placed between two towers as part of town walls. It belonged to the Soardo family up until Veronica Soardo married Alvise Bembo in 1618. The palace, then, changed owners. During reconstruction, objects from a Bronze Age settlement were found in the basements. It was included on the list of 30 most important monuments in Croatia and was completely refurbished in 2012.  Almost 2 million euros were invested in its reconstruction. The money was received through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Italian union and the National University of Triest.

It was a 'discovery of the century'. The bones retrieved from the sea were in fact dinosaur bones. It has been estimated that at least ten dinosaur species lived in this area. One of them is the Brachiosaurus, one of the largest dinosaurs ever to roam the earth whose weight reached 30 tons and could grow to be up to 25 metres long. This discovery put Bale in the World List of Paleontological Sites. Bale's site, as far as it is known, is the only find in the world that has dinosaur remains under the sea. It is believed that some of the bones are 200 million years old.

There are about eighty homesteads in the area, called stancije in Istria. Stancije used to be family run affairs and we plan to revitalise about forty stancije in the area in order to give a special identity to Bale's interior.

The crypt has a lapidary which protects many stone and archaeological sculptures and fragments of decorative stone plastic. Liturgical furniture of a locality in the vicinity of Bale (St Mary, St Mary, San Polo) from ancient times to late medieval times is also part of the crypt's treasure. The stone sarcophagus with the remains of Blessed Julian patron saint of Bale from 1595 is also kept in the crypt. His remains were transferred in 1755 to a new reliquary in the church. There's a panel from 1645 above the sarcophagus which used to mark the spot at the St Michael's monastery where the saint's body was

Bones of Sauropodus i.e. dinosaurs which lived on Earth more than 200 million years ago are being held in the showcases of the gallery. The bones were found at the sea bottom in Colone bay in 1992 then cleaned and stuffed in the Paleontological museum in Monfalcone.

Most of the squat looking houses are built of stone and are connected by stone - paved alleys. The old town core, with its castle Soardo Bembo and a number of religious structures like the parish Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Homage to Saint Elizabeth and the crypt offers a special atmosphere to those living in Bale as well as to Bale's visitors. It is a real luxury spending your vacation here - stone houses bleached by the bora wind, shadowy shelters of the wines above entrances, terraces and porches as well as streets with stone benches are a perfect beginning for your dream vacation. Olive, Wines and Cheese The tourist card of Bale would not be complete without the agricultural dimension. The area of Bale is a real treasure throve of indigenous sorts of olives as well as other symbols of healthy food and traditional ecological agriculture and quality wines and cheeses. Bale's olive oils, for the most part produced from the indigenous Buza but also from other sorts of olives form an inevitable part of all the prestigious publications dealing with olive oils. Bale's olive oils have also received many awards and prizes. This should come as no surprise in the light of the fact that olives have been grown in this area since Roman times. Thirty centuries of the olive growing tradition has given birth to a legend claiming that travellers could negotiate the way from the town to the shore, a distance of seven kilometres, hopping from one olive to the next without touching the ground at all. Bale's citizens want to share the beauty of their olive groves and in future it will be possible to stroll down an olive path and all those who want to enjoy the charms of olive picking will be able to indulge in that joy in the olive groves there. In the desire to give an additional boost to olive growing in the district the planting and growing of olives is actively encouraged. Even though Bale's citizens traditionally do not grow olives for commercial purposes many typical Istrian vines can be found in the area - Malvasia and Istrian Teran. These wines will always go down well with Bale's cheeses and homemade Istrian cuisine - something that lacks not at all in Bale. There is no rush in Bale, so we suggest all those who lead a stressful life to stop and enjoy the scents of aromatic herbs. The scent of sage, immortelle, rosemary, lavender and many other plants is spreading through Bale and its surroundings and the only thing you have to do is take a deep breath - it will relax your body

This is an archaeological zone where one can see the remains of ancient structures (walls, rooms, presses). There is a small promontory close to the church, believed to be a remnant of architecture of undetermined date. Bale's Shoreline Bale's shoreline is a pristine part of Istria's coast, without big hotels and other buildings. The shoreline is nine kilometres long, surrounded by exceptionally clean sea. Down by the sea you are not too far away to smell the scent of Mediterranean vegetation, which grows there in abundance. Located in the west of Istria Bale's shoreline boasts a magnificent view of the Brijuni islands, and its sunsets will, surely, forever grace your memory. The shoreline area is rich in archaeological sites, and one can also find remains of old roads, parts of Roman villas and oil presses and there is also a magnificently preserved fortification complex from the Dual Monarchy period. On this really pristine shoreline, only seven kilometres from Bale are the San Polo and Colone camps. They stretch along some ten kilometres of Bale's shoreline and have a sewage system and tap water. The camps also have mobile homes for rent. The camps are being managed by Mon Perin ltd. This is a special Bale story,too. Mon Perin has been founded in 2005 by citizens of Bale, the county of Bale and its friends. At the beginning the company had 740 stakeholders and a share capital worth 12 million kunas. It is today worth around 30 million kunas, while the company counts more than 900 stakeholders. Since the people of Bale decided not to sell their land, Mon Perin got the land where the camps are to manage for 50 years. The shoreline will retain its pristine condition in the future because it has been decided that the distance from the sea to the nearest accommodation facilities will be about 700 metres, which is a reflection of wishes and visions of those who manage the town of Bale and, by extension, of all those who live in the district. They all work towards a common goal - to develop Bale in harmony with the environment and they will not falter in that determination.

It was reconstructed in neogothic style with an elegant porch entrance. Various crests are built in the porch, amongst them the crest of the county of Bale - a white cross in a red surface. The town's administration apparatus is housed in the Town Hall today. It also keeps the statute that Venice Republic ratified in 1477.

Their story would certainly begin around the so-called \""\""Baranja mountains\""\"" or Banovo hill. The hill was initially called the Golden Hill, or Mons Aureus, by the ancient Romans, and then the Habsburg court gave the name Goldberg. Yes, it was the Habsburgs who drank Baranja wines, but this is not their only connection with Baranja, more in another story. You can already see the real wine experience that awaits you in Baranja. In addition, Baranja comes from the Hungarian words bor - wine and anya - mother which means mother of wine. Baranja tourists start their wine adventure by driving through endless vineyards, and this is the reason why Baranja is nicknamed by some as \""\""little Tuscany\""\"". Some even say that the appearance of Baranja vineyards can be compared to those in France. But the drops they produce are also worthy of a French bottle. In any case, more than 1,000 hectares of this \""\""green sea\""\"" leave no one indifferent, and make the people of Baranja extremely proud. Wine culture is passed down from generation to generation. In some wineries, the 5th generation currently produces their wines according to the recipe of their grandfathers, but with a drop of modern taste.. Winemaking has become very popular among young people, so there are more and more young producers, especially female producers. That's right, this is another interesting wine fact. In Baranja, almost every wine cellar has its own female wine producer or oenologist. Go on a wine tour of Baranja and become a real hedonist. Most of them are daughters of winemakers who inherited knowledge and skills from their fathers and grandfathers, but also wine lovers who stand shoulder to shoulder with famous Croatian (male) oenologists. Numerous wine cellars, the so-called gators who preserve world-renowned wines are proof that Baranja region is mother of wine. Such wine cellars, unique in the world, are buried in Banovo hill, providing the same temperature throughout the year, which makes them suitable for storing wine.. Built more than a century ago, today they are a real tourist attraction. And the unique experience of drinking wine in these cellars will surely remain in your memory forever. The most famous gators are located in the villages of Suza and Zmajevac, while the largest wine cellar in this part of Europe, but also the oldest in Baranja, is located in Kneževi Vinogradi, the one of the Belje winery. Baranja surduk are roads and streets cut through the hill, some created as natural gullies, and some by human hands. The most famous are those in Zmajevac and they are the ones who hide and hide numerous cellars (so-called gators).

The three-day event offers locals and visitors a rich program - creative workshops, fairs, performances by folklore ensemble from Croatia and other countries, concerts, exhibitions, plays, competitions and wine evaluations, and a rich gastronomic offer accompanied by quality wines. The first day of the event is held under the name \""\""Premium Wine Marathon\""\"". This day is intended for people who do not like crowds and are fans of intimate gatherings with top wines. Namely, on Fridays, only wines that have at least 83 points from a rating are poured, or if the Decision on the release of wine states the number of points (minimum 80) due to the labeling of wine with the traditional term QUALITY / TOP WINE The Wine Marathon program starts on the second day at 12:00 with an ethno fair, an international folklore festival, and an entertaining part before the START. The main event of this event is the Wine Competition, a unique wine event where competitors (marathoners) find Zmajevac cellars and evaluate the wines of local winemakers. Very few people finish a marathon on their own because they are simply sorry to do it mechanically and quickly. They usually stop at a point where there is a good team and atmosphere, and anchors there. Everyone wants the wine magic to last as long as possible and deliberately postpone or bypass the end points of the marathon. And the fun with the sounds of timeless songs in one of the gators always lasts until the early morning hours. The third day is planned for the Days of Open Cellars in Baranja, when visitors, who may have liked a wine, can visit each of the winemakers from the Wine Marathon and stock up on fine drops of wine. Name? The wine marathon is clear to everyone, but what does bor mean? 80% of the population of Zmajevac is of Hungarian nationality, so we respected multiculturalism in the name of the event. Bor in Hungarian means wine. Why marathon? When the contestant registers, he gets a map, a glass, a glass holder around his neck, a T-shirt and vouchers for wine consumption in the cellars, which are marked on the map. What is important is that the wine roads (surduci) are marked with colors, the marathoner starts on the wine road what color is his T-shirt and glasses. They all tour the same cellars, they just don't start in the same cellar because the winemakers wouldn't be able to handle that crowd. But if there was no time limit it would be just a tour of the basement. The marathoner should visit 20-27 cellars within 5 hours on a 5.8-kilometer route in 3 surduks on the Zmajevačka wine road. Each contestant gets 1 dl of wine to exchange vouchers, you have to guess the type of wine and write it on a map, and evaluate the quality, then you get a stamp or signature from the winemaker and the

Ancient Romans once inhabited these pre-historic fortifications. Throughout history, Barban was also known for its strategic position, dominating over the hill and ruling the valley and the bridge over the Raša river. With the passing of time, the town transformed into a fortress surrounded by walls, round and square towers, ramparts, large and small gates, and a castle. The Loredans, a Venetian noble family, purchased it from the counts of Pazin in 1535. Although they stayed in Barban only periodically, the members of the family, represented by their captain, tore down the old castle and erected a palace and St. Nicholas parish church in its place. Located in front of the large gates is a small stone church from the 15th century dedicated to Anthony the Great, its interior covered in frescos.

However, our ancestors lived in very different times. Those were the times when pirates roamed freely along the waters of Kvarner Bay, bent on pillage and presenting a constant danger to the inhabitants of Kvarner bay populace. Mighty forts, built on the easily defensible natural positions were the safe-keepers of common folk and the guardians of sea lanes. One prime example of such is the Corinthia Castrum, an early Byzantine fort built on the Sokol peninsula, nestled between the mighty mountain ranges and the shore. The fort's purpose was to gard two important bays - Vela Luka and Mala Luka, the nearby settlment, and the rich fertile soil of the Bosar lowlands. Accessible only from the sea, Corinthia was a mighty deterrent to any hostiles foolish enough to wade into its range and made the life, even in those troubled times, that much safer.

The ruins feature characteristic northern Adriatic sacral architecture and it is interesting to see the names of all investors that made the contruction possible inscribed in the mosaic floor. While exploring the church, you will note the tombs and a sarcophagus in the church vestibule. Baška Castle - Kaštel The castle once stood proudly overlooking the shore and the town surrounding it, and during thje Middle Ages, the noble Frankopan family ruled Baška from this very site. The ruins of Baška Castle that we can see today are located near the church of St. John.Its name - Besca, was first mentioned in 1232, The castle stood in the centre of Baška, then called Pogradica, until the late 14th century, when it was razed by Venetians. Defiant inhabitants refused to give in to the demands of the mighty Republic and the town with its castle paid the price.

Ever since St. Cyrill created it in the 9th century, Glagolitic script, the oldest Slavic alphabet has taken root and began to appear in various texts, slowly replacing Latin. Its primary purpose might have been to spread the Christianity more easily among the local populace, but on Krk, Glagolitic alphabet quickly found its way into public documents, even as other parts of Croatia still remained faithful to Latin. Literature, legends, novels, and legal documents were also written in Glagolitic, preserving and solidifying Croatian culture and heritage. Baška Tablet and Glagolitic script This is the site where Baška tablet, one of the most important finds of Croatian heritage was found, entirely by accident. The 800 kg limestone, one meter in height and two in width might not quite have the importance of the Rosetta stone, but the markings on it are nevertheless extremely significant for Croatian history. It was in 1851 that young priest by name of Peter Dorčić stumbled upon this rare and immensely valuable find. The lay hidden in the church pavement since the beginning of the 12th century. Originally it was a part of the church septum (altar rail) along with another inscribed tablet, of which only parts were found. It took 24 years to fully translate the text written on the tablet and its content proved to be invaluable, proving the existence of a Croatian sovereign at the time of its creation. It explained how Croatian king Dmitar Zvonimir donated the land to the church of St. Lucy to the local Benedictine monastery. This was the first known instance of a Croatian name being written in Croatian language with the use of Croatian Glagolitic script. When visiting the church today, you will see the copy of the famous tablet, as the original is displayed in Zagreb, in the Academy of Science and Art. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable sight and a place you just have to visit. Baška Glagolitic Alphabet Trail If you wish to find out more about the glagolitic script and the history of this region as well as Croatia, there is no better way than to take a stroll on the Glagolitic trail. It is an outdoor route, a kind of an open air museum showcasing natural beauty of the landscape and Croatian heritage. Perfect for families but equally enjoyable alone or with a group of friends. In around two hours, you will discover 34 stone sculptures with engraved Glagolitic letters. The route will take you from the Treskavac pass to Draga Bašćanska and Jurandvor, then along Sv. Ivan on the hill to the sculpture located on Cape Kricin in front of the Bunculuka bay. The final, 35th sculpture with a Greek letter Omega, is located on the restored Stara Riva, completing the tour with its symbolic circular shape. Explore it on your own or take a guided tour, currently offered in English, Slovenian and Croatian language. Embark on a fun and educational trip where you will learn the letters of the Glagolitic alphabet.

Parents enjoy delicious meals in restaurants, glancing at their kids as they splash around in the shallow sea, whoosh down the aqua gun or row away on the pedal boats. Vela plaža rings with laughter and adventure for young and old, activities for every taste, while food, drinks, snacks, souvenir stands, and rental shops await just off the strip. Vrženica Like most of the loveliest Baška beaches, Vrženica features an incredibly clean, turquoise sea and gorgeous, perfectly round, white pebbles.

Vela Plaža Imagine a tropical beach. The long strip of sand extending into the shallows. The warm breeze playing with island flora. Chill music. Now swap the glittering aquamarine and cream hues with the magnificent Mediterranean earthiness of azure and beige. Swap palm trees with fragrant Tamarix and myrtle and add some smooth, sun-kissed pebbles. This is what the two-kilometre long Vela Plaža offers as a backdrop for your adventures. The most popular summer destination on the island brims with good vibes and fun. Parents enjoy meals in restaurants, glancing at their kids as they splash around in the shallow sea, whoosh down the aqua gun or row away on the pedal boats. Friends bicker and mock each other over the results of yesterday's beach volleyball match, sipping frosty coctails in one of the bars. A few meters away, with sea up to their shins, a large circle of people slaps the tiny rubber ball around, trying to keep it from touching the waterline. The beach buzz is as relentless as the summer heat, energizing everyone present. The vibe is as addictive as it was in 1908 when it all begun. The sea is supremly clean as the Blue Flag awarded to the beach in 1999 proudly attests. Vela plaža rings with laughter and adventure for young and old, activities for every taste, while food, drinks, snacks, souvenir stands, and rental shops await just off the strip. It is an inviting and motley ensemble, the king you might see on a holiday reel filmed by a drone and instinctively wish you were a part of.

A pebbly paradise where the shade is always nearby if you wish to above that you are floating, suspended midair. The beach is completely natural and offers no services apart from a small bar serving cool refreshments to visitors. Clothing is optional here, making it the best of both worlds, whether you wish to skinny dip or show off your swimsuit. Storišće Fifteen minutes walk from Jablanova lies this truly beatiful beach. Like most of the loveliest Baška beaches, Storišće features an incredibly clean, turquoise sea and gorgeous, perfectly round, white pebbles. There are no facilities here, so make sure to bring your own refreshments and snacks when you plan a visit, as well as plenty of sunscreen. Make sure to bring your sturdy, hiking boots, as the path to Storišće leads across some karst and macadam trails. Still, the beach is absolutely worth the troble taken to reach it. And if you are not a fan of hiking, you can get here with a taxi boat. Vrženica It is a profound feeling, quite enchanting actually, to take off your hiking boots, rub the aching soles of your feet and dip in the cool sea of Vrženica. After all, it takes quite a hike to reach it, braving the rocky path through the canyon, the sun, and thorny underbrush. If you prefer to avoid hiking and wish to arrive as fast possible, a taxi boat servise is also available. You might spot a few fellow adventures here, but not many. Those that arrive are like you they take path least travelled, or in this case, the beach least visited any day over the crowded public ones. They prefer the sound of the waves and the crickets to the booming from the speackers of a nearby beach bar. While you are here, relax and take it easy. Appreciate the tranquillity and all it will do for your soul. Island of Prvić Prvić could be translated roughly as The first. It is a fitting name for this small island, easilly visible from the Baška shore. First of firsts, Prvić is Croatian largest uninhabited island (no mean feat, as Croatia is known as a country with a thousand of them). This was not always so, as Stražica lighthouse was once home to its crew, but the advents of solar-powered batteries meant that presence was no longer required. The second first is the fact that Prvić is the windiest island in Croatia, enduring the stormy Bura winds over 200 days a year. This might make it a bit unsuitable for human dwellings, but benefits of this salty clear wind on the islands flora and fauna are many. Riding along its shore on the tourist boat from Baška, you will notice the gorgeous reddish purple, and grey hues of the island. Making landfall, enjoy the sweet fragrances of island flora dominated by sage and immortelle. The saga honey made here by beekeepers from Baška is nothing short of sensatonal. But the delicious Prvić products do not stop here. Lamb reared here diets on salty, windswept herbs, making it one of the most prized in the world, and one you should definitely taste, prepared in the traditional way in one of the Baška restaurants. Prvić is home to no less than 17 endemic plant species, and a nesting ground for birds, making it an important Croatioan botanical and ornithological reserve since 1972.

This tradition is preserved to this day on Krk. Mrgari sheep pens are the most impressive example of this technique, as their unusual shapes resemble flowers. They were used to separate the flocks of different owners ever since men first tamed this land. These flower-shaped pens can be found only in a handful of places in the whole world (Island and Wales, UK). The „Path to the Moon\"" Trail The most interesting hiking and biking trail around Baška is without a doubt the Path to the Moon. This entirely man-made trail through the inhospitable rocky country is a testament to the persistence of the locals. The trail is somewhat demanding and offers plenty of shade under the pines and each brief stop you make offers gorgeous views of Baška and the shoreline so make sure to bring your camera with you.

It then follows the flow of Vela Rika river, the only natural flowing watercourse on Krk, and leads to Batomalj, a charming village with a rich heritage. After that, the path continues toward the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Gorica, taking you to the restored Mrgar (flower-shaped dry stone wall sheep pens) Lipica. A stroll along the educational trail will take you through some of the most fascinating areas in the vicinity, brimming with tradition, history, and natural beauty. Prvić Island Prvić is Croatian largest uninhabited island.This was not always so, as Stražica lighthouse was once home to its crew, but the advent of solar-powered batteries meant that their presence was no longer required. Prvić is home to no less than 17 endemic plant species, and a nesting ground for birds, making it an important Croatian botanical and ornithological reserve since 1972. Riding along its shore on the tourist boat from Baška, you will notice the gorgeous reddish, purple, and grey hues of the island. Making landfall, enjoy the sweet fragrances of island flora dominated by sage and immortelle. The sage honey made here by beekeepers from Baška is nothing short of sensational. But the delicious Prvić products do not stop here.

The closest one is Bunculuka, located near the nudist camp, with the limestone cliff towering above the sea. This was the first climbing spot on Krk and is still very popular among enthusiasts. It offers ten routes and a maximum height of 15 meters. The second one is Portafortuna (The Luckbringer), just about 10 kilometres away, between Draga Baščanska and Punat. This cliff offers routes for all skill levels, with the highest one covering 30 meters. The third, also located between Draga Baščanska and Punat, you will find Belove Stene, the highest climbing area on Krk, leading up to the Obzova peak. Even as the cliff offers shade throughout most of the day, we recommend an early visit to avoid the summer sun on the 30-minute hike to the destination.

Set on a cliff 250 meters above sea level it will treat you to a view opening up on the bay of Baška, Vela Plaža, and Prvić island. A lovely mrgar called Ljubimer is nearby, so make sure you visit it if you decide to hike up to Bag. The most probable theory about the origin of the name Baška is that it is derived from the name of Bag peak. If the mountain is Bag, the valley beneath it would be called Baška valley that gave the name to the town. Kuntrep & Diviška Kuntrep is the oldest ornithological reserve in the world, dating back to 1969. Spanning the shoreline from cape Glavina to Mala Luka bay, it is approximately 10 kilometres by 1 kilometre in size. Many birds found their home on its steep cliffs jutting into the Adriatic sea. The most famous is the Griffon vulture, but many other majestic, endangered European birds can be seen here as well, such as Short-toed eagle, Peregrine falcon, and European shag. The reserve is reachable only by foot or by a boat, but let this not be a deterrent for an inspiring field trip. You will get a chance to observe some of the most glorious birds of prey, clinging to life in the harshest of environments. This is also a great opportunity to combine your exploration with seeing the mrgari, as these unusual and beautifully constructed sheep pens border the reserve on its highest part. Then there is the Diviška lokva — a pond divided by dry stone walls into five parcels owned by five families as an extension of their pastures, where sheep come to quench their thirst.

A stroll along the educational trail will take you through some of the most fascinating areas in the vicinity, brimming with tradition, history, and natural beauty. The trail starts at Zarok village near Baška, where you will see the unique Zarok sandy area. It then follows the flow of Vela Rika river, the only natural flowing watercourse on Krk, and leads to Batomalj, a charming village with a rich heritage. After that, the path continues toward the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Gorica, taking you to the restored Mrgar (flower-shaped dry stone wall sheep pens) Lipica.

Whichever you choose, don't forget your camera, as there will be sights you will want to show to your friends and family when you return.

One of the most famous churches of Krk island also has a special signicance for Croatian history, as Baška tablet was discovered here. The exact date when Benedictine abbey and the church of St. Lucy were erected in Jurandvor is not known, but we can deduct from the text of Baška tablet that they have existed since the early 12th century. A Romanesque Catholic church is best known for the Baška tablet, but there is another significant detail hidden in its bell tower - the first known instance of the checkerboard pattern of Croatian coat of arms. If you visit Jurandvor on the 13th of December, on the Feast of Saint Lucy, you will have a chance to witness a very old tradition, known as the throwing hlipcić (a small loaf of bread). Many centuries ago, the church operated a watermill nearby. Flour produced here was then given to the locals to bake bread, which was then thrown from the belltower after the mass, to the faithful gathered in the courtyard.

One of the important stops on the trail, just before it takes us uphill to the Obzova peak is The Church of Our Lady of Gorica. Ever since the 16th century, it has been visited by pilgrims and the faithful from all over Krk island. Legend has it, that the original church built in the 11th century near Batomalj was under constant threat of pirate raids. The angels themselves took notice and came to the aid of local villagers. They took the statue of the Madonna and placed it on the hilltop, far from the reach of the would-be looters. The grateful locals then built a new church here, naming it fittingly - the Church of our Lady of Gorica. The way to the sanctuary will take you through the beatiful nature and sets the mood perfectly. It leads along the walled meadows where sheep and donkeys graze peacefully and stream over a stone brige you will come upon a staircase with 237 stone stairs, polished by the sun and the multitude of feet that climbed it since its creation in the late 19th century. Pilgrims from all over the world follow The Way of the Cross here, visiting the Stations made of broze. In especially difficult times throughout history, the faithful carried the statue of Our Lady of Gorica on their shoulders in a procession from Baška to the sanctuary. The Church of St. John The Old Man is a moniker given to the church bell chiming solemnly from the belltower of St. John since 1431. St. John stands upon a hilltop where the heart of Baška was located in the antiquity.The church thus once cast its benevolent and protective shadow on the town and the faithful. Throughout the centuries, the town gradually grew and developed into the plain and the coast. Built in the 11th century, St. John was originally an imposing Romanesqua style edifice with no less than seven altars. A parish church until the middle of the 18th century, it was abandoned a century later, as the town migrated from the hill toward the coast. However, it was restored in 1855, after a cholera outbreak subsided. While visiting the church, take a stroll through the graveyard surrounding it and enjoy the most beautiful view of Baška and surrounding villages, as well as Prvić and Rab islands. Many of the renowned Baška residents found their resting place here.

A Baroque three naved edifice with a 28 meter bell tower remained in its original form until the 20th century, when the facade was completely reshaped in the eclectic style featuring beige tones and ornamentations.

Šurlice or Valcići Once upon a time, a feast, celebration or any major event was unimaginable without a healthy serving of dishes prepared with homemade pasta called šurlice or as they known in Baška - valcići. On those big days, local girls and women gathered in large groups and prepared šurlice by coiling the thinly rolled pasta sheets around wooden knitting needles. Folk songs were sung, diligent hands were kept busy for hours on end, and the result was a 5 centimetres long pastry, hollowed in the middle, and absolutely delicious. Not so much a part of the tradition of these parts as it is a way of life, this ingenious pasta gives the Italian pastaios a run for their money. Owing its name to the particular shape of an elephants trunk (surla), each piese soaks up the sause a blissful tinypackage filled with flavour. Once exclusive to the homesteads of Istra and Kvarner, you need not go for a home visit to taste some of the dishes made with Šurlice.

"639","[""Document""]","{""section"":""Asparagus"",""id"":""0edfa9d66c87c6e54b771995a24a8f00"",""text"":""Have you ever tasted a Krk asparagus? No, we are not talking about the domesticated, thick stalked variety you can find in local supermarket. We are talking about the thin and delicate queen of nature's bounty, growing wild and free in the countrside. Wild asparagus, handpicked and served in homea and restaurants across the northern Adriatic is a treat you simply must taste at least once in your life. The dark green delicacy is made even more special by ita short harvesting season (it growa in the spring and picking is restricted) and its scarceness. Taste  it in traditional fritaja (omelette) or as part of the meat, seafood, and pasta dishes. The interesting, slightly bitter taste, quite unlike the common asparagus, gives each dish  a very special, luxurious finish. Vrbnička Žlahtina The name of the grape and consequwntly of the wine comes from the local word žlahten meaning noble. This proves the importance of winemaking to the island of Krk. Grape growing and viticulture are tied with thie region since the antiquity. Owing to the idel climate conditions, coastal Croatia is home to many serious wines. While Dalmatia is known for the red grape varietals like Plavac Mali, on Krk, in the area around the village of Vrbnik and near Baška (St Lucy Žlahtina), delicious white dry wine Žlahtina reigns supreme. Characterized by the discreeet aroma rounded by flowery notes of wild sorb, immortelle and apple and low in alcohol, tannins and acid, Žlahtina is a summer wine next to none. Light and refreshing it is able to lift the spirit and bring a smile to the face in a single sip.

If he had it on a more regular basis, maybe he wouldn't eventually have the great city burned. We will never know. Sheep graze freely here and their diet consists of salt infused aromatic herbs that grow in the wild, making the meat supremely delicious. This salty, aromatic herb fed lamb is an ingredient of many traditional dishes and more modern interpretations served on Krk. Widely recognized as one of the finest in all the land, in stiff competition with Pag and Cres island, it might just be the ultimate delicacy of Croatia. There are many ways pf preparing lamb, all of them traditional and deliciuos. Try it prepared charcoal grilled with aromatic herbs, or ispod peke (under the bell), or simply do what the locals do and order a lamb žvacet (stew), served with valcići pasta. krk lamb  is so  well known and so  loved by all who have had the opportunity to taste it that Baška featires an annual festival dedicated to this delicacy.

One of the most famous churches of Krk island also has a special significance for Croatian history, as Baška tablet was discovered here. The exact date when Benedictine abbey and the church of St. Lucy were erected in Jurandvor is not known, but we can deduct from the text of Baška tablet that they have existed since the early 12th century. A Romanesque Catholic church is best known for the Baška tablet, but there is another significant detail hidden in its bell tower — the first known instance of the checkerboard pattern of Croatian coat of arms. Baška's Glagolitic Trail If you wish to find out more about the glagolitic script and the history of this region as well as Croatia, there is no better way than to take a stroll on the Glagolitic trail. In around two hours, you will discover 34 stone sculptures with engraved Glagolitic letters. The route will take you from the Treskavac pass to Draga Bašćanska and Jurandvor, then along Sv. Ivan on the hill to the sculpture located on Cape Kricin in front of the Bunculuka bay.

The angels themselves took notice and came to the aid of local villagers. They took the statue of the Madonna and placed it on the hilltop, far from the reach of the would-be looters. The grateful locals then built a new church here, naming it fittingly — the Church of Our Lady of Gorica. The way to the sanctuary will take you through the beautiful nature and sets the mood perfectly. It leads along the walled meadows where sheep and donkeys graze peacefully and turns uphill, following a narrow road constructed only a few decades ago. Crossing a tiny stream over a stone bridge you will come upon a staircase with 237 stone stairs, polished by the sun and the multitude of feet that climbed it since its creation in the late 19th century. The Church of St. John the Baptist St. john stands upon a hilltop where the heart of Baška was located in the antiquity. The church thus once cast its benevolent and protective shadow on the town and the faithful. Throughout the centuries, the town gradually grew and developed into the plain and the coast. Built in the 11th century, St. John was originally an imposing Romanesque style edifice with no less than seven altars. A parish church until the middle of the 18th century, it was abandoned a century later, as the town migrated from the hill toward the coast. However, it was restored in 1855, after a cholera outbreak subsided.

A Baroque three naved edifice with a 28 meter bell tower remained in its original form until the 20th century, when the facade was completely reshaped in the eclectic style featuring beige tones and ornamentations. During your visit to this lovely historic and sacral monument, discover the main altar adorned with a painting by a local master named Fran Jurić. It depicts the Holy Trinity and the coronation of the Virgin Mary. The Chapel of St. Mark St. Mark is located close to Vela Plaža. It is a small chapel, modest in appearance and at first glance not much different than typical village churches dotting the Adriatic islands and seaside settlements. But this particular chapel hides a rare and very interesting find beneath its foundations. Twin basilicas that once stood there are a 1500-year-old marvel of sacral architecture. Christian symbolism is most clearly visible in the cross-shaped floorplan of the larger, northern basilica, as well as in the cross-shaped baptistery and baptismal font, making it quite unique for the early Christian period. The mosaic tiled floor has been only partially uncovered, but even such it shows the exquisite craftsmanship and grandeur of a monument equal to the greatest Christian churches. 4 Islands MTB race

It takes only a few minutes from the mysterious silence of the historical Bibanum to get to the crowd of white Jader, the centre of the region, events, St. Donatus, sun, sea organ. Bibinje is wrapped by a veil of airy summer nights and the song of a cappella bands which intertwine with the stars in the clear sky. Endless blue mornings - when farmers go into the vineyard covered with drops of pure dew, and fishermen go to the sea - take us back just at the time when the mystery of life would ajar the door of the past. From the walkways Talina to the square Sri sela there are restaurants, small cafes and special bars situated on the edge of the murmur of waves, in the cicadas singing, putting on trial all the senses. The whole Bibinje summer is mottled by events, folklore evenings, festivities, concerts. Inverted to Zadar islands, covered with smooth pebbles that have been surrounding them for centuries by the sea, Bibinje beaches are a small version of the breath of Dalmatia. Come and experience the Bibinje away from alienation, find the answer in romance, in the blink of breath, touch of hand, the smell of seafood, which extend across cobbled streets, built by hardworking hands of Bibinje builders.

If you want to relax away from the big crowds, and still attend events and cultural and natural heritage, Bilice is the ideal place for your stay. On the mainland it borders with the oldest Croatian town on the Adriatic coast, Šibenik, and on the sea side with the town of Skradin. They are only a few kilometers away from the Krka National Park. Bilice is located on the shores of Lake Prukljan and stretches to 24 hamlets and four larger bays, among which the most prominent bays are Stubalj and Vrulje. There is no larger industrial zone nearby, so the surroundings of Bilice are adorned with untouched nature, and not far from Bilice are more important tourist centers: Šibenik, Krka National Park, Skradin. Along the entire coast in Bilice stretch beautiful beaches in a series of small picturesque bays, which are not crowded even in the middle of the season, the access to the sea is shallow and are ideal for families with children. Along the beaches are bars and restaurants and enough parking spaces. The area where today's Bilice and all its hamlets are located has a long history, so we find the remains of life from prehistoric times and it is a part of the wider cultural landscape along Prukljan. Due to the richness of fish in Prukljan, the gastronomic offer is dominated by indigenous local specialties such as čokalice, eels, scallops, cuttlefish, etc. If you want to move and relax at the same

It was probably destroyed by the Turks and the legend says that they transferred the image of Our Lady from the old chapel, which is now kept in the church of Our Lady outside the city in Šibenik. Above the chapel door there is an inscription in Latin: SACELLUM ANTIQUITUS CELEBRATUM OB DEIPARARE VIRGINIS IMMAGINEM QUAE IN TEMPLO SUBURBANO TERRAE CONTINENTIS NUNC ASSERVATUR PIA PLEBES GESTIENTI ANIMO A MACERIIS RENOVAT. NONIS OCTOBRIS A.D. 1869, which means: Sanctuary (chapel) where the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary has been worshiped since ancient times, which is located in a church near the city. It was built in a dry stone wall, on October 9th 1869 and nowadays it has been completely rebuilt by the pious people.

It was probably destroyed by the Turks and the  legend says that they transferred the image of Our Lady from the old chapel, which is now kept in the church of Our Lady outside the city in Šibenik. Above the chapel door there is an inscription in Latin: SACELLUM ANTIQUITUS CELEBRATUM OB DEIPARARE VIRGINIS IMMAGINEM QUAE IN TEMPLO SUBURBANO TERRAE CONTINENTIS NUNC ASSERVATUR PIA PLEBES GESTIENTI ANIMO A MACERIIS RENOVAT. NONIS OCTOBRIS A.D. 1869, which means: Sanctuary (chapel) where the image of the Blessed Virgin Mary has been worshiped since ancient times, which is located in a church near the city.

Some caterers claim that everything caught in the canal towards Prukljan and in Prukljan itself tastes at least three spears better than what is taken from the sea. Every year in the summer season, Fishermen''s Night is organized by the Sports Fishing Society St. Joseph, which especially for that day catches and offers fresh fish such as sea bass and gilthead sea bream and pike, so all these delicacies can be tried at promotional prices and truly enjoy the flavors of Prukljan and the autochthonous atmosphere of Bilica.In the Bilica area, several varieties of

"804","[""Document""]","{""section"":""Prukljan lake"",""id"":""bf564a1fc711754abd593ebb9de33570"",""text"":""Prukljan is considered the second largest natural lake in Croatia and is located in the lower reaches of the river Krka. After the magnificent waterfalls, the river gradually flows into Prukljan, and then into the deep sea bay, where the town of Šibenik is located.Due to the contact of the sea and the mixing of fresh water, the water is brackish in the surface and salty at the bottom. The northern part is very shallow (1-2m) while the southern part is deeper (up to 25m). Cryptodepression is a natural phenomenon, which means that its surface is above the sea surface and its bottom is below sea level.In the northwestern part of the lake there is a small canal through which the  Guduća River also flows into the lake.It is surrounded by small picturesque places Zaton, Raslina, Bilice and Skradin.

Many recognized the importance of this event, so last year it was included in the Top events of Croatia, and at the beginning of 2020 it was awarded the \""\""Sunflower of Rural Tourism in Croatia\""\"" in the category of \""\""rural tourism and traditional events\""\"".

But there are many stories about city to be told. It was founded by Empress Maria Theresa, and in time its centre became situated in the Bjelovar-Bilogora County and Bjelovar-Križevci Diocese. Today it is a 21-century live urban story. Bjelovar is known for its grid layout of streets, the large and spacious central park in which the musical pavilion is located and surrounded by four statues drawing us back in time to the city's military headquarters, nicely linking the past and present. Strolling through the streets or sipping a coffee on the popular Korzo promenade, are just some of the suggestions to experience Bjelovar. It is a city of known for handball, the popular First of May in the early morning hours and multiculturality. The city, which from the time of its founding, has attracted people with its charm and created lasting relationships. We believe that once you get to know the city, you will understand what we are talking about. Once you start exploring the city's surrounding areas, you will encounter the vast and gentle hills of Bilogora, one of the lowest lying Croatian mountains. Bilogora is made up of the word \""bilo\"" meaning \""beat\"", so we call it the green heart of Croatia. Small rural settlements surrounded by centuries-old forests and fertile fields, orchard and meadows, above which old belltowers rise, preserving the customs and stories of a Bilogora mythology. Yes, here you can listen to the fairy tales of astonishing creatures, which take you back to your childhood. The beauty of Bilogora rural settlements becomes evident in the original local cuisines. You can try žganci (corn porridge), trganci (flour noodles) with sour cream and enjoy kvargl, a cone-shaped cheese made drying and smoking the cheese, where its originality has earned it the protected designation of origin (PDO). In rural settlements, the custom of baking kovrtanje (yeast-leavened bread) has been preserved, a sweet bread baked for special occasions. Given that it has been ecologically protected, Bilogora is also a honey haven. You can buy the best quality honey to sweeten your tea or bake honey cookies. As is the custom, after eating delicious local foods, wine is used to toast the occasion, wines that are increasing the popularity of the region. In recent years, craft beers have also become popular, giving specific Bjelovar and Bilogora cuisines a finishing touch. We invite you to explore this region which will captivate you with its beauty, the dear and hospitable people, and its rich cuisine. If you come by car, on foot, bicycle or even on horse, no problems. The designated paths and routes will lead you to the nicest Bilogora places. Now, wake up the explorer in you and head off, keep exploring and discover the beauty of Bjelovar and Bilogora. Along designated paths or led by a guide through hidden places, every choice is great for discovering the beauty and cuisine awaiting you Preserved nature, nice lookouts and kind people are only some of the reasons for visiting This lowland mountain extends through Central Croatia, from Kalnik to Papuk, covering a total distance of 90 kilometres. The extent to which Bilogora is a lowland small mountain is best reflected in the fact that its highest peak is Rajčevica at 309 metres above sea level. The name Bilogora contains the word \""bilo\"", meaning heartbeat. Therefore, so just as a person has a heart, so too Croatia has Bilogora. Do not let that discourage you, especially if you like mountaineering, because the Kamenitovac Mountaineering Lodge is located on it at 242 metres above sea level, offering amazing views across a large part of Central Croatia. Sometimes, on a clear day, the view extends all the way to neighbouring Slovenia and the peaks of the Julian Alps, again a testament that the mountain always can surprises visitors. We invite you to explore Bjelovar and Bilogora by bicycle.

We suggest that before beginning your travels, you take one of the tourist catalogues: Bilogora tourist route, Pisanica eco-ethno trail and Bilogora and Bjelovar. They will help you plan your trip and provide clear information on what to visit in this destination. Hopefully, it will be just the first of many weekends you spend in this part of the Croatian hinterland. Explore the history, cuisine, economy and cultural tradition which this region has preserved and proudly displays Bjelovar and Bilogora are hosts to some the most important events held in the Bjelovar-Bilogora County. From the start to the end of each year, many programs offer various interesting and entertaining content. In January, the International Percussion Ensemble Week (IPEW) takes place, marking the start of each year with joyful rhythms. In February, Bilogora rural settlements hold mask carnivals called mačkare. Bjelovar also hosts the International Beekeeping Fair as well as the Wine and Viticulture Fair. For many years, one of the biggest Croatian theatre festivals has been the Bjelovar Theatre Echos or the BOK Festival. The one in March is intended for a younger public, whereas the festival held in May is for a more mature public. Na daske koje život znače (Tread the Boards) offers the best performances from Croatia and neighbouring countries. Given that Spring is the start of agricultural activities, and you are in the fertile Bilogora country, it comes as not surprise that it is the place where the International Spring Bjelovar Fair is held. The agricultural tradition and relationship people have with the earth and animals, animals which have helped people in their everyday work, is the basis for the Đurđevo na Bilogori event, presenting traditional customs related to commencement of work in the fields. During those day, the Đurđevo bonfire is lit, horses receive blessings, and Veliko Trojstvo lives in the spirit of tradition and customs. Now we are in June, which has been for full quarter of century the month when the biggest cultural, entertainment and tourist event called the Terezijana is held (named after the Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa). You will be treated with three days of programs, the best performers and good entertainment intended for people of all ages.

Biograd boasts a modern marina containing roughly 1000 berths in the sea and 200 berths on the land, complete with boat servicing, secure and maintained parking places for over 700 vehicles, as well as other marine support services. In Biograd, there are a few chartered boat agency services and sailors, as well as a sailing club. The best time for sailing in Croatia is between April and October when there is plenty of sunshine and the sea is suitable for swimming. Thanks to mild tidal movement and weakened sea currents, the entire Biograd aquatic area is custom made for enjoyable sailing. Fans of sport and recreational fishing, be it sweet water or seawater, will be in their element in Biograd! In the hinterland behind Biograd, only five kilometers away, stretches out Lake Vrana, one of Croatia's largest lakes and nature reserve. Believe it or not, this otherwise sweet water lake contains both salt water and sweet water types of fish!

If you want to avoid the more challenging riding paths, we suggest you try neighboring towns like Saint Filip & Jakov. Another choice: the sturdy, unpaved road along the coastline to Soline will be excellent, since it winds along through thick pines from the center of town to the Kumenat settlement southwards, towards the town of Pakoštane. For those who prefer a greater challenge and a little bit more of a time allotment, continue the route around Lake Vrana which is 38 km long. But that's not the big one - there is even a greater goal - which leads you by the lookout post at Kamenjak towards the town of Vrana, and which lengthens your ride by a few more kilometers. Did you know that the Biograd Ilirija Hotel provides 14 tennis courts? Biograd na Moru is, exactly for that reason, the ideal place for all those who can't live without their favorite sport while on vacation. It's also a great opportunity to have always wanted to put a racket in their grip and try out their first forehand.

If you love to bicycle, join us in our traditional Biograd Bike Race. Celebrate May 1 (our traditional summer kickoff) by participating in the dynamic Slovenian weekend, filled with interesting activities. Gastro Biograd is a manifestation which, in June, transforms the seaside walkway into a heavenly array of flavors and aromas of authentic products from the whole of Croatia, and Biograd Night is the merriest summer night with many festivities for all grown-ups. In its relaxed and intimate edition, you will find the Biograd Street Music Festival. And maybe, more than anything else, you are in love with sailing? Biograd with its two marina represents an important nautical center, and the Biograd Boat Show provides high quality proof to that reputation. Biograd na Moru is a royal, Croatian town which was first mentioned in the middle of the 10th century, and in the 11th century, it became the seat for Croatian kings and bishops. Biograd experienced its most glorious days as the capital under Croatian rulers during the Middle Ages, and in 1102, the Austro-Hungarian King Koloman was crowned right here in Biograd! Numerous material evidences confirm the ever-turbulent and rich history of the Biograd area, which have been archived in the exceptionally interesting Historical Museum, with easy access due to its location on the seaside walkway. Biograd is small city, but with an absolutely rich history from which Christian sacral buildings are mirrored, such as the parish basilica of Saint Anastasia (1761.), as well as the early Romanesque-styled church of St. Ante (13th century), and the church of St. Rocco (16th century). As far as ancient Biograd architecture is concerned, only the basilica of St. Ivan (11th century) managed to survive the Venetian destruction of Biograd in the year 1125, but on the nearby island of

They are waiting to be discovered by strolling along its streets and observing its town squares, where some startlingly amazing discoveries will come to light. You'll learn that Biograd, in a former lifetime, was the capital of Croatian rulers where, in 1102 Hungarian-Croatian King Kolomon was crowned. Tucked away from the tourist beat, true cultural treasure awaits you in our Museum of Culture and Heritage. As a twist of history, the infamous sinking of the Venetian vessel in the 16th century brought an assortment of fascinating items to our doorstep, more than 10,000 in fact, which are now featured in a unique exhibition unlike any other that you'll find along the Adriatic shoreline. The story will continue to unfold, as told in the museum and the numerous churches: All you must do is see and hear the murmurings within their interior, which through the powers of observation, will transmit a type of time-travel through cultural storytelling! During hours with the most intense sunshine, except under the cool shade of the pine trees, choose the cool and delightful Heritage Museum of Biograd located on the seaside walkway also known as \""the Riva\"". Think of it as engaging on a treasure hunt!

Every year, during Labor Day, Biograd is flooded by Slovenian neighbors overwhelming the city with their spirit. It is a very active, playful and entertaining spirit that carries away everyone else with it! During the Slovenian Weekend, you can do jogging, sail, walk or just dance in the evening! The most visited in recent years was the Biograd Run Race at 1.5 or 10 km, along the route by the sea over the waterfront, beach, park and Soline Forest Park. Older guests prefer Biograd Walk, recreational 4.5 km long walk. Slovenians cannot imagine themselves without a bicycle, so it is of no wonder that they adore the family bicycle race. As part of the event, an attractive Biograd regatta is held every year. During Gastro Biograd, the entire waterfront becomes one huge table, the Biograd Table! The menu includes only autochthonous Croatian products and dishes, from Slavonian, Istrian, Lika to Dalmatian specialties. Various master chefs and local caterers compete on who is the better chef and visitors taste the dishes! In 2019, the main attraction was seafood risotto for 500 people! There was also the largest frittata on the Adriatic, but also continental risotto with mushrooms prepared by our friends from Bjelovar.

The sea air contains negative ions and ozone which encourage deep breathing and fill us with life energy. The promenade along the sea as far as Brela extends from Jakiruša to Berulija is 7 km long and, if you feel ready, you can extend it to other towns of the Makarska Riviera. Regardless whether you walk or ride a bike, a normal physical effort suffices for you health, which is 150 minutes of exercise a week. This is enough for the heart to start working faster. Recommendation: When you go for a walk, wear comfortable clothing and shoes. Breathe in with full lungs and start! On the first day walk for 30 minutes. For the first 5 minutes warm up walking lightly, and in the past 5 minutes slow down. Fast walking on the first day of exercise should take 10 minutes maximum. Make short steps, bend your arms in the elbows under a 90° angle and keep them at the level of your waist with your shoulders relaxed. Start the walk 3 times a week and then every day. Walk whenever you can. With time slowly increase the duration of your walk until your reach 60 minutes. You may do the promenade also by Nordic walking. This is an activity that engages almost all large muscles in the body, and it also ensures favourable conditions for the circulatory system operation. Besides, Nordic walking is intended for all ages, so that the activity can be practiced by children, adults and the elderly. We recommend organised walks 3 times a week with the supervision and a programme of a professional guide! Bikini Dive Centre is a small family company offering many adventures above and below the sea. Dives are uniquely tailored for experienced divers and for beginners, organized in small groups and a friendly atmosphere. In the offer are diving courses for amateurs and for professionals.

It was never completed so it is possible to reconstruct all phases of its construction. It was built, or rather laid, on a slope of Biokovo, between 357.41 and 443.73 meters above sea level. The rise does not exceed 6%, in order to make the road very comfortable for driving carts, horse-riding and walking. The architect Frane Zavoreo is the project engineer of the French road on Biokovo. Interpretation boards are positioned along the road, in order to bring you closer and to provide you an understanding and to explain you the manner and purpose of building this truly exceptional and valuable road. In addition, the entire road is a wonderful viewpoint on Brela, the Riviera of Makarska and the islands! The French road is listed in the Register of Cultural Goods of Croatia on 25th September 2017.

The Mediterranean monk seal is species of seal and one of the most endangered mammals. In this region they are also known as morski medvid (sea bear) or morski čovik (sea man). Fishermen considered them to be enemies as they often destroyed theirnets. It disappeared from the Adriatic Coast in the 1960s, however, we have been able to see it lately, especially along the Istrian coast. \""Sea, sea...\"" they say that the Croatians exclaimed this on the Dupci pass when they arrived at the Adriatic. Here the rocks swoop more than 100 m deep. The Vruja cove is a gigantic system of wells with an underwater spring of 60 m in diameter standing out, from which a huge amount of water is springing. It is located immediately below the Dupci pass (288 m) separating the Biokovo mountain (1762 m) from the Dovanj mass (864 m), a part of the Omiš Dinara. There are large springs at Drvenik, Drašnice and Gradac, but none is equal to this one. By the water springing from it, it is probably the largest in the Adriatic. Below the steep rocks there are beautiful and sheltered gravel beaches which are best accessed by sea, by ship from Brela or Pisak, due to extraordinarily steep and inaccessible terrain surrounding them.

Nestled between two giants - the Velebit and Mala Kapela mountains - there is a region with a rich tradition, dating all the way to the pre-historic period, and a heritage whose traces are felt all around. Our nature inspires envy, and the images of Brinje and its surroundings are unforgettable. Where the sky meets the green forest peaks, magic happens, legends are born, preserved, passed from one generation to another, and songs are written about the all-around beauty. The crisp and pure air fills up your lungs, opening up your appetite for the delicious Lika food, while the atmosphere and warmth of this karst region will make sure you return to the green paradise that is Lika over and over again. Our winters are truly cold, our summers cool, our autumns magical, and our springs wide awake. Every season holds its magic, all the more reason for creating another story and visiting again.

The parish church in Brtonigla was named after St. Zeno, an early Christian bishop from Verona, who is also a patron saint of this Istrian town. It is generally considered that St. Zeno was a native of North Africa. During his 10-year service as a bishop, he carried out several reforms of church customs. The inside of St. Zeno's church in Brtonigla is light and clear. The ceiling is flat, the apse is polygonal and the side walls are decorated with marble altars, made in neo-baroque style. A small vestibule is located between the entrance portal and the main church area. There are two larger windows at the front, while the decoration beneath the roof cornice was built as an array of hanging arches. The high, peaked belfry rises from the middle of the front, and on each side of the belfry, there are two small spires which imitate it. St Zeno was built between 1859 and 1861 at the location of the similar older church which some sources date back to 1480. Although there were some indications back in the 16th century that the old church might have been expanded, that did not happen until the second half of the 19th century, when the building received its present shape. In the second half of 20th century, a statue of St. Zeno reading the missal was added above the front portal. The statue is a masterpiece of the academic sculptor Aleksandar Rukavina, a great aficionado of this area. When passing through Brtonigla don't miss the opportunity to visit Mramornica cave, considered by many speleologists to be one of Istria's largest and loveliest subterranean structures. Mramornica Cave was first mentioned in the writings of travel writer Albert Fortis in 1770. Today, it is open to both the young and the old seeking for adventure. From the very entrance of the cave, a steep stairway leads down to a large chamber filled with dripstone formations of different colours and huge stalagmites some 13 metres tall and up to 10 metres wide. The trails leading through the cave are well-maintained and equipped with safety railings from which you can peer into the cave's mysterious but inaccessible parts that reach down to inconceivable depths. To find your way to Mramornica Cave, just follow the signs leading to the Sterle agritourism farm where the cave is located. Nature lovers will enjoy the refreshing chill of the cave's underground chambers, and the whole family can take pleasure in the various activities offered at the Sterle farm. To residents of the area, Nature Park Škarline is an inseparable part of local identity and holds an indelible place in the collective mind. Visitors to the area sometimes fail to discover this perfectly preserved nature park located only two kilometres from Brtonigla and named Škarline after the stream that springs in the park. Along its course to Mirna River, several kilometres to the south, the stream has created a luscious, green canyon, one of its kind in Istria. A two-kilometre macadam track leads from the village of Nova Vas, near Brtonigla, along the edges of vineyards to the nature park. In dry weather, the nature park can be reached by car. To find out how to reach the park directly from Brtonigla, contact the local tourist office. The canyon is not immediately visible from the park entrance. First, you will encounter a tame, spacious landscape with meadows, two small lakes and a bridge. Several benches and a tap for potable water make this picture-perfect area a great spot for a picnic, and fun and games. Sveti Juraj fortress, also known as Santi Quaranta, is a protected cultural monument in the municipality of Brtonigla, located above the Mirna river valley near Nova Vas. The fortress is divided into a northern and southern part by an interior wall. Today, its trapezoidal floor plan and well-maintained walls are still visible.

The gallery collection has been broadened with the work of the artist's colleagues: a bronze bust of Aleksandar Rukavina created in 1989 by academy educated sculptor Tonči Orlić exhibited at the entrance, and a portrait of the sculptor's mother painted by academy educated painter Alma Orlić in 1987. The concept of the gallery's spatial organisation and layout is based on sculptures presented as characteristic of the chronological and formative phases in the artist's work. The gallery is conceived as a circular exhibition space encompassing four interconnected spaces and a small depository. Although the gallery serves primarily as a memorial centre it also, from time to time, hosts exhibitions featuring other artists and musical and literary presentations, both inside the gallery and outdoors. *Guests can visit the gallery by making reservations in advance with the Tourism Board office. Separate visiting times can be arranged for organised group visits.

He belonged to the younger generation of rebellious artists who announced the new trends in the then Yugoslav arts by their joint exhibition in the Zagreb Modern Gallery in 1960. He worked with various materials and motifs, and the centre of his interests was mostly the human figure. He used the contrast of the processed and raw surface of the material, mostly rock and wood. Rukavina left Zagreb in early 1960s and moved to Istria. In 1960s he lived in Buje and taught arts in local schools, until he moved to Brtonigla in 1971. Throughout this time, he also worked as a sculptor and initiated many cultural projects. The Church of St. Roch, the patron saint of Brtonigla, was built on the location of the former 14th century Church of St. John the Baptist. This church was \""moved\"" after the old Church of St. Roch, which was located elsewhere, became unusable after a plague outbreak in 1855, and was relocated to the Church of St. John the Baptist. Today, the Church of St. Roch features a wooden altar with statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Roch, St. Sebastian, St. Peter, St. Paul and St. John the Baptist, to whom the church was once dedicated. The church is rectangular with a semi-circular apse. Saint Roch, protector against plague and cholera According to some written sources, St. Roch was born in 1295 in the French town of Montpellier with a mole in the shape of a cross on his chest. He belonged to a noble family, however he lost both his parents at a young age. After the death of his parents, he sold all his belongings and distributed them to the poor, and then went to Rome as a pilgrim. On his numerous journeys and pilgrimages, he did good deeds and helped victims of the plague, of which he also eventually died. St. Roch is venerated in many churches and cities in Croatia today, and believers call upon him most often when they need protection from infectious diseases. The tradition of celebrating St. Roch in Brtonigla on 16 August gave birth to one of the most popular folk celebrations in Istria - the Feast Day of St. Roch. This three-day event includes diverse sports, entertainment, music and gourmet programmes, and draws numerous visitors from Croatia and abroad. On the Feast Day of St. Roch, a traditional holy mass is held, and there is a procession from the Church of St. Roch to the parish church in Brtonigla. Istria sits on four different types of soil, which are named after their colours - black, white, red and grey. Aside from colour, these soils differ in numerous other characteristics that make them suitable to raise various agricultural products - especially wine grapes. One of the four jewels of northwestern Istria - Brtonigla - is unique in the entire Istrian peninsula (and perhaps even further afield) in that its terroir of a mere 32.72km2 contains all four types

In 2010, in local vineyards featuring nearly identical microclimatic conditions, the local Istrian Malvasia variety was planted - of course, in each of the four different types of soil. In the years that followed, with painstaking, diligent monitoring by experts from multiple scientific fields, the project enjoyed spectacular success! Malvasia grapes raised in the same way, subjected to the same vinification process, even harvested on the same day, resulted in wines of equally high quality but completely different flavour characteristics! These four wines from the four soils of Brtonigla received their own labels, and they can be found often on the wine lists of well-known northwestern Istrian restaurants, who pair them with various gourmet delights. After Malvasia - Teran! The perspective of the project \""Four Soils - Four Wines of Brtonigla\"" hasn't stopped with just one variety of grape. The identical process has also been undertaken for another local Istrian variety - Teran. But the hard-working residents of Brtonigla then asked themselves, and with good reason - why stop with wine?! These were the foundations for the idea of producing olive oils on the four Istrian soils. If you are interested in sampling the fruits of this interesting project, you can do so with local producers, who will gladly tell you the story of the four soils and the four wines of Brtonigla - alongside a glass or two of wine, of course. Folk festivities are an opportunity to discover Brtonigla and its inhabitants in a truly unique way. Some of the most fascinating events are the Choco & Wine Fest (February), the Istrian Malvasia Festival (June), Colours of Tradition (July), St Roch Feast Day (August), Mushroom Days (October) and many others.

On the main square, next to the resplendent Church of St. Servulus, stands a belfry dating back to the 15th century. In fair weather, the view from the belfry encompasses parts of four countries: Slovenia, Italy, Austria and Croatia. In 2011. the belfry has been completely renovated to allow visits for a greater number of tourists. The wooden stairs leading to the top have been reconstructed. A safety railing and transparent, Plexiglas sheets protect the observatory encircling the bells, providing an unobstructed view in all four directions. A wire mesh protects the bells, which are also an attraction. The belfry is one of the highest in Istria, next only to the 63-metre belfry in Vodnjan, some 70 kilometres to the south. Buje - \""the Guard of Istria\"" and a city with two bell towers What makes Buje even more interesting is the fact that its old town has two belfries. The second belfry, slightly lower but nonetheless imposing, is located next to the Mother of Mercy Church. The bell tower was given the nickname \""the guard of Istria\"" because it was the watchtower for the entire region, and the 13th-century city seal bore the image of the bell tower, the guard of the

This is an area with wavelike hills covered with vineyards, olive groves and fields sprinkled with oak, cerris and pine woods and Mediterranean meadows with wild thyme and fir trees and a karst belt full of interesting geological phenomena. Today, the entire region of Buje-Buie is the most famous winegrowing part of Istria with numerous wine cellars and farmhouses (agritourism). There are lovely medieval towns in the vicinity; the most famous ones are Grožnjan-Grisignana, Momjan and Završje. Five kilometres from Buje-Buie towards Pula-Pola lies the settlement Krasica with nearby hamlets like Gardoši, Baredine, Lozari, Punta and others. The scattered hills used to be seats of prehistoric fortresses. The findings from the Roman Age reveal huge fortresses like Gradina, located at the important road - Via Flavia. Inscriptions, artefacts and coins, votive figurine of the Goddess Fortune, fragments of carved marble and columns are kept in museums in Trieste, Pula-Pola und Poreč or have been built into the side wall of the church in Buje-Buie.

St Servulus is the main church in Buje and one of the most important late baroque monuments in Istria. With its monumental dimensions, it is used only in the most formal occasions, for mass festivities on St Servulus day or for the organ festival, a prestigious cultural event. The church in its present form was erected in the second half of the 18th century, at the previous location of the old roman-gothic three-nave 13th century church. The elements of the older building were inbuilt into the new edifice, and they are visible at the front even today. It is believed that an antic temple was located there a long time ago. The Church of Our Lady of Mercy, built in 1587, is located on Trg Slobode Square, which also features a 17th century bell tower and the city ethnographic museum. The year 1587 was carved at the outside jamb of the left side door to the church, as a memorial to the completion of works. In front of the church, there is a picturesque »fresco« from 1590 and a belfry with a clock and a 22 high passageway. With apparently simple but harmonious architecture, it contains invaluable artworks in its interior. Art historians claim that the sculpture of Our Lady of Mercy is one of the most beautiful wooden sculptures in Istria. It is the work of the Venetian workshops of Paolo Campsa and Giovanni de Malines.

The prehistoric hill-fort was abandoned at that time but resettled in late Antiquity by refugees fleeing barbarian invasions. Buje gradually acquired the features of a fortified medieval town. The period up to the 13th century After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the reign of the Ostrogoths, the town peacefully became part of the Byzantine Empire. Slavic colonisation soon began, and by the late 8th century, Buje was absorbed by the Carolingian Empire. In documents, the town is first mentioned as Castrum Bugle in 981 in a charter of the German-Roman emperor, Otto II. At the time, the Kaštel (Castle) of Buje was under the Patriarchate of Aquileia, an ecclesiastical and administrative unit of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 13th century, the town was given a higher level of autonomy and became a Free Commune. In the early 15th century it was occupied by the Venetian Republic following the signing of a surrender treaty in 1412. In retaliation for the town's resistance to the Republic and loyalty to the Patriarchate of Aquileia, the Venetians tore down its defence walls, fortification and belfry.

Today's historical and tourist landmark was once a popular meeting point and refreshment place for many travellers and waggoners. The house is also a monument to the reputable and enterprising Čebuhar family, whose lineage was broken in 1963. It is located in the very centre of Čavle, so do not forget to visit it. The old town of Grobnik today represents the most important cultural point of the wider area of Grobnišćina (Grobnik region), and the tourist potential guaranteed by its good location and rich heritage makes it an unmissable destination for all visitors to this picturesque area. We also invite you to take a stroll through the old town of Grobnik, through the time and legacy of the people who have lived here. The widely known Grobnik bell-ringers have an interesting story to tell about every item that they use, from their costumes and equipment to the way they move. Although they are part of folklore today, they have long played a key role in the survival and protection of villages from enemies, whether in the form of barbarians or wild beasts. Take a peek into their marvellous world full of symbolism and tradition, and if you like it, become a bell-ringer! Grobnik has long been recognised as a destination for lovers of good local food. First and foremost are the unmissable polenta withpotato and Grobnik cheese, as well as the products of Grobnik's skilled butchers. Potato polenta (\""palenta kompirica\"") fed generations and generations of the people of Grobnik, but they did not remain indebted to it.Today, the big Festival of Polenta and Cheese is organised in honour of polenta, family gatherings do not pass without it, and the dish has grown into a famous delicacy that every visitor to the Grobnik region wants to try. Few dishes have so many fans, so if you haven't already, try this repeatedly sung about dish at the first opportunity. Bon appetit! The favourite delicacy of the people of this area is Grobnik cheese, in whose honour the Festival of Polenta and Cheese is organised every year. Cheese has a very long tradition and specific way of being made. You can find out more by visiting one of the local Grobnik cheesemakers and check out how this traditional Grobnik dish fits into the 21st century. The Grobnik area (Grobnišćina) provides ideal living conditions for both humans and plants as well as animals. So, it is not surprising that the people of this area successfully achieve coexistence with nature, and visitors come to explore the richness of flora and fauna, and often return home with a sprig of lavender for their wardrobe, sage for tea or some bay leaves for the perfect lunch. In addition to various species of domestic grazing animals, nature lovers can find the habitats for various birds in Grobnik's forests. One is a raven that makes its nests on rocks, trees, or even uses the abandoned nests of other birds. You will also often find black woodpecker, the largest woodpecker in the region, and the slightly smaller nesting bird thesong thrush. Whilst staying in nature, you will also encounter a variety of butterflies, and one of the frequent inhabitants of these areas is the painted lady, mostly orange in colour, and it can spotted from April to October. Plants that you can see along the roads will give you special pleasure when walking or cycling, and one of the perennials is the golden lily that which grows in the nutritious soils in the deciduous forests or in the mountain and hilly meadows that the area abounds in. When hiking between June and September, we might also come across the protected edelweiss. In the rocky areas of the lowlands, you will be captivated by the scents of various grasses and native Mediterranean herbs such as sage, immortelle, heather, rosemary, lavender and laurel.

As early as the first days of January, we start with interesting events. First up is an unusual event called the Kobasica Open, where we evaluate the best-cooked sausages. This continues into the carnival period, Platak Masquerade events. Summer is reserved for the Festival of Polenta and Cheese, the Folk Theatre Festival and the Bartojski Kotlić cooking festival.

It was first mentioned in written documents in 983. Since that time, the Castle and the growing civil area that surrounded it have been given as present, conquered and sacked, destroyed, rebuilt and sub-leased many times. It has changed owners, managers and names. It was under the dominion of Patriarchate of Aquileia, and then under the County of Gorizia. The whole Middle Istrian area, then called Graftschhaft Mitterburg, Contea di Pisino or the County of Pazin was being governed within the safety of its masonry. Since 1374, the whole County had been a private property of the Austrian house of Habsburgs. The Possert Castle was presented to the public in 2016 when archeological research has been completed. The fortress is turned to attractive viewpoint.

Pazin is mentioned for the first time in the year 983 in a document by which Emperor Otto confirms the donation of the fortress Castrum Pisinum to the bishops of Poreč. Life is in this town on equal intensity in winter and summer and every first Tuesday of the month a veritable river of curious people from all over Istria flows here, visiting the traditional Pazin Fair. Pazin is the place that is adorned with the largest and best-preserved medieval fortress in Istria - the Pazin castle - which is located on the cliff above the Pazin cave, a unique work of natural forces through the canyon of which the river Pazinčica flows. The fact that the Pazin cave leaves no one indifferent is evidenced by the fact that, just like the Pazin Castle, we find it in the works of numerous travel writers and it was an inspiration for many famous writers, such as Dante, Jules Verne and Vladimir Nazor. Cerovlje is the central place of a large municipality spreading over the undulating landscape northeast of Pazin and comprising numerous hamlets and villages: Borut, Draguć, Grimalda, Gologorica, Paz and Pazinski Novaki. Such natural features brought to it plentiful particularities throughout history and continuing until the present time. Inaccessibility and isolation were the reasons for the very poor or non-existent influence of Rome to this remote piece of its province. Pathless ravines in the east, fortified by carefully arranged forts (Gradina, Paz, Šabec, later Belaj, Posrt) in the Middle Ages created an unassailable frontier used by the Istrian Margrave to expand his dominion which was further defended by the forts of Boljun, Lupoglav, Roč, Črni grad and Beli grad in the north and Letaj, Barban, Rakalj and Sutivanac in the south. The slow arrival of modern changes to the secluded villages, which were only recently upgraded with good roads, led to the depopulation and complete abandonment of some villages. On the other hand, it also influenced the preservation of many ethnologic particularities and the way of living, which have already been made history in other parts of Istria.

It was created by water torrents which made a 3500 meter long canyon in limestone rocks. It starts at the Zrinščak tunnel and ends at the Boljunsko polje. It is special for its pointy rocks, with 50-90 meter tall towers, some of which were destroyed during the construction of the Učka tunnel. The highest part of the canyon is at 600 meters above the sea level, while the lowest is the one at the Boljunsko polje at the level of only 153 meters. The canyon is covered by lush vegetation ranging from willows and poplars to beech and jew. Some of it is the rainforest. Vela draga has been protected as a nature reserve since 1963 and after, 1998, as a geomorphologic monument of nature. Apart from teaching about geological phenomena, this trail also teaches about alpine and free climbing, sports which have existed in Vela draga since 1931, when alpine climber Emilio Comici climbed his first alpine route. Vela draga has thus in time become a known climbing spot for acquiring precious experience by many Croatian and European alpine climbers. The symbol of Karojba are the four impressive pine trees right in the centre of the town. Those trees were declared a botanical monument of nature in the year of 1966. The distinctiveness of these trees is that they grow deep in the continent, away from the sea. The pines (Pinus pinea) have the so-called umbrella treetops. The girth of the biggest tree is 3,3 metres and the height 14,5 metres.

Interestingly enough, they arranged the cloister in the way that they put the new Renaissance columns on the ground floor and moved the old Romanesque ones to the floor above. The monastery church of St. Peter and Paul the Apostle were then restored in Gothic style. It was re-dedicated in 1755 with baroque facade and in the same style, which we encounter very rarely in Istria, richly equipped interior of the church. The cemetery church of Saint Mary of the Rocks, situated 1 km to the north-east from Beram, within itself holds one of the most valuable acomplishments of Istrian medieval painting. Well preserved late-gothic frescos almost entirely cover the inner walls of the church, and they were made by master Vincent of Kastav. The paintings were commissioned by Beram confraternitiy of St. Mary, so most of their space is dedicated to scenes from lives of Mary and Jesus. The strongest impression leaves the fresco called Dance of the Dead, where in front of our eyes kings, merchants, cardinals, even the Pope himself dance hand in hand with death. In the XVIII. century, during the baroque period, the church was expanded and renovated, which caused most of the frescos to be damaged or destroyed.

Riding on cycling tracks, enjoying numerous bathing sites, fishing, rafting, kayaking and canoeing are only some of the activities this area offers. Other ways to explore the natural beauties of this area include quad riding, horseback riding or taking tours organised by travel agencies. Due to its geographical position, the Four Rivers area is at the crossroads of all historically significant routes leading to the Adriatic Sea, which resulted in different cultures overlapping through the centuries. So, here you can find archaeological sites and old towns (Barilović, Bosiljevo and Novigrad na Dobri) as well as more recent industrial heritage of the well-known factory Pamučna Industrija (Cotton industry), around which the town of Duga Resa has grown. Four rivers lie in the very heart of Croatia. For a long time, the Kupa, Korana, Mrežnica and Dobra have been the favourite destination for those seeking peace, privacy and pristine nature. Our rivers are a perfect place for an active vacation. Whether you choose to swim in the clear emerald-green waters, go rafting or canoeing over river rapids, the Four Rivers will give you an unforgettable experience. The Four Rivers area offers you an opportunity to enjoy our rich gastronomic repertoire of traditional dishes prepared in a modern way. Pamper your taste buds in some of our excellent restaurants with specialties ranging from freshwater fish, game and mushrooms from our local forests to meat and vegetable dishes rich with ingredients grown at our local family farms. Experience a true rhapsody of taste accompanied by a glass of fine wine or homemade craft beer in a divine ambience. The Tourist Board of the Four Rivers Area organises a variety of food, entertainment and sports events throughout the year, some of which have already become traditional. So, during summer, you can enjoy various activities at our bathing sites or visit the Grin Fest, which offers a wide range of music, culture and entertainment events.

The beaches of the island of Cres are perfect for visitors who love nature and authentic settings. Few are those who won't find the one that suits their taste - organized, natural, large, small, rocky, pebbly, or secluded beaches. Some of them even bear the Blue Flag designation, and the beach at the Kovačine camp is adapted to the needs of people with disabilities, equipped with necessary aids and suitable access to the sea. Beaches in settlements are usually easily accessible, while most of them are located in more remote places, so it's advisable to prepare with good fitness and a good mood.

The population of griffon vultures on Cres is the only one in the world that nests on cliffs directly above the sea. The \""Visitor Center and Griffon Vulture Recovery Center Beli\"" in the town of Beli on the northern part of the island of Cres is dedicated to the protection of griffon vultures. Professional staff and interactive exhibits contribute significantly to creating a brighter future for griffon vultures. The Center also includes a recovery center for rescued birds. Most of the rescued birds are released back into the wild after rehabilitation. Thanks to the Center, griffon vultures are a common sight on the island of Cres: if you look up to the sky, you may spot these enormous birds with their wings outstretched, soaring on air currents in search of food. In captivity, griffon vultures can live up to 40 years, but their lifespan in the wild is somewhat shorter. Their wingspan can reach up to 280 centimeters, and adult birds can weigh up to 12 kilograms. Griffon Vultures are Adventurous Spirits: Young birds embark on a multi-year journey during which they roam Europe, Africa, and the Middle East until they reach sexual maturity at the age of five. Griffon vultures from Cres have been spotted in areas from Africa to Sweden. After their grand journey, they return home to find a mate and build a nest. Griffon vultures mate for life. One pair produces one egg annually, usually in the middle of winter. The chick hatches after 110-120 days, and in spring, it learns to fly. This is the most delicate period for their survival: since this population nests directly above the sea, chicks often fall into the sea while attempting to learn to fly. To prevent the birds from drowning as they are unable to extricate themselves from the sea, the staff at the Center (see above) play an invaluable role: during this period, they watch over the nests in shifts and swiftly rescue the chicks that fall into the sea, which would almost certainly perish without their intervention. Griffon vultures are truly nature's cleaners and are closely connected with free-range sheep farming on the island: sheep live and die in the wild, and griffon vultures feed on their carcasses, thereby keeping the environment clean and preventing the development of diseases that decomposition processes would favor. Problems for griffon vultures began with the decline in sheep on the island. However, this is not the only reason for their decline and endangerment. You can learn much more about these fantastic birds by visiting the \""Visitor Center and Griffon Vulture Recovery Center Beli,\"" which we highly recommend.

Here you can discover and taste Cres. This event enables small producers, ie family farms to exhibit and present their domestic products made of wool, olive oil, figs, cherries, lemons, wood, etc. It encourages citizens to be more actively involved in preserving the value of their own production, especially traditional souvenirs and handicrafts as well as the preparation of old dishes. It helps promote organic production, rural tourism, traditional crafts and already somewhat forgotten customs.

In the very centre most of the houses are one-storey or two-storied buildings while in the harbour public buildings were built such as the Duke's Palace, Loggia, arsenal, numerous patrician palaces and the so called fondaco where corn was kept. The Franciscan monastery complex is located just off the historical centre. As usual with monasteries, its original location was outside the city walls, but as the city grew the monastery complex became part of the city centre. The complex comprises several buildings: Saint Francis of Assisi's church with an adjacent bell tower, two cloisters, dormitories, a refectory, and gardens with an olive grove.

This was confirmed by the pioneers of essential oil production from sage, helichrysum, and bay laurel - father and son Andrija Linardić - who already in 1903 established an essential oil factory in the small village of Martinšćica on the island of Cres. In 1908, they were the first in the world to distill essential oil from helichrysum, and they conducted business with the largest pharmaceutical companies of that era in Europe and America. On the island of Cres, more than 1,400 different plant species grow. Sage, helichrysum, dandelion, nettle, and other wild and medicinal herbs make the island of Cres a true botanical garden. Olive is also indispensable, and from its autochthonous varieties, šimjaca and plavac, high-quality olive oil is obtained, characterized by all the scents and flavors of the island. Extra virgin olive oil Cres is the first olive oil in the Republic of Croatia protected by the mark of origin. In addition to the plant diversity, the untouched nature of the island of Cres and favorable weather conditions throughout the year create opportunities for the development of outdoor activities (hiking, mountaineering, cycling). Cres is the largest Adriatic island, with several climate and vegetation zones, and a freshwater lake of drinking water, located in the heart of the island (Vransko Lake). Besides Krk and Lošinj, Cres is now considered one of the richest islands in terms of flora, many of which consist of relict and endemic plants. The richness of flora is complemented by the richness of fauna. The abundant plant and animal life poses a real challenge for nature enthusiasts. Cres is one of the last habitats of a very rare bird - the griffon vulture. It's also interesting to note that there are no venomous snakes on Cres. In addition to the griffon vulture, sheep are another symbol of Cres, with around 10,000 of them freely grazing on the island's vast pastures. For centuries, the Cres sheep has been the main source of food on the island, nourishing and clothing generations of islanders.

Over the past two decades, \""Route\"" has become known primarily for promoting sheep's wool, which is no longer used on the island as it once was but is left in nature. They have offered at least a partial solution to this problem - processing wool using the felting method into various useful items, thus turning them into authentic island souvenirs. Although the ecological problem of wool on the island of Cres, and in Croatia as a whole, has not yet been solved, \""Route\"" has successfully utilized the discarded wool wealth and popularized working with wool. They are recognized through numerous creative felting workshops, appearances at fairs, and exhibitions. They serve as a successful example of long-standing hard work, new ideas, and project development.

In addition to the permanent exhibition that presents the practices and customs related to sheep farming, a series of projects are carried out to promote the preservation of indigenous folk architecture, revitalization of the local economy, the use of renewable energy sources, environmental protection, landscape interpretation, and the development of projects related to sustainable island tourism. The exhibition is designed as a unique journey through the year: as visitors walk through the exhibition, they simultaneously traverse the seasonal activities that do not align with calendar years but are synchronized with the biological and climatological features of the micro-location. Each room is dedicated to tasks that occur in a specific season. Visitors can also watch a three-part documentary film that documents the processes of tanning sheepskins, sheep shearing, and cheese making. In a separate room, there is a photographic exhibition by Dražen Lapić titled \""Judi z Garbina,\"" which pays tribute to the residents of Garbin, the western part of the island of Cres, who have preserved the tradition of sheep farming to this day. The renovated complex of the former parish manor, where the Sheep Farming Museum is located, represents a unique example of rural-urban architecture. Various events and pleasant gatherings with visitors are held in the courtyard and garden.

More than 1,400 different plant species grow here, such as sage, immortelle, spurge, dandelion, nettle and other wild and medicinal herbs, which make Cres a true botanical garden. The island is also home to the Cres sheep, which is the most common animal (there being several thousand of them on the island), and also to the griffon vulture, a protected bird species and one of the largest flying birds in the world. Unspoilt nature and good weather throughout the year provide numerous opportunities for outdoor activities. The island of Cres offers attractive hiking and biking trails that combine the wilderness of the hinterland with the shimmering beauty of the coast. A tour of the island will take you to interesting historical and cultural sites such as the town of Cres, built in the Venetian style, the ancient settlements of Lubenice and Beli, or the old fishing villages of Valun and Martinšćica. Traditional island cuisine is a real treat for food lovers. It is based on local ingredients such as fish, extra virgin olive oil, honey, cheese, and Cres lamb, which is a well-known island delicacy. If diversity is another name for wealth, then the island of Cres is a real pearl and a unique holiday destination, for it is one of the last places where you can experience the Mediterranean as it once was. The town of Cres is the largest settlement on the island. Located in a sheltered bay, in the past it was a convenient harbour for ships in bad weather. This geographical location led to the development of fishing, seafaring and shipbuilding, and the shape of the bay and its sheltered position contributed to the construction of the marina in the southeastern part of the town. It is surrounded by numerous olive groves, from which the famous Cres olive oil is produced. The town of Cres is rich in cultural and historical monuments, most of which date from the Renaissance period. The presence of numerous palaces of wealthy Renaissance families, larger and smaller churches, town gates, monasteries, a tower and the town loggia give Cres a special cultural and historical significance. The town is characterised by a network of charming streets opening into small squares, and a walking tour will reveal its many interesting sights: Remains of the town walls (town gate), Arsan Palace -

Cres is an elongated island, with the northern part having a subcontinental climate, while the climate in the southern part is already Mediterranean. As a result, the northern part is significantly different from the rest of the island: it is covered with dense forests of oak and chestnut trees, teeming with mushrooms and rocks covered in moss, and inhabited by forest animals such as hares, deer, wild boars, mouflon, and even moles (which are not found on other Adriatic islands). Snow is a common occurrence in winter, and in the summer, the forest is pleasant and cool compared to other parts of the island. In the past, Tramuntana was a populated area, but its villages have been gradually abandoned over the past century. The reasons are typical: challenging living conditions, world wars, and emigration to more developed areas. Visitors are often moved by the sight of the remnants of villages that still stand alongside once-cultivated land. Not far from one of these villages - the village of Petrići - is the deepest cave on the island: Banićeva Cave, with a depth of 100 meters. Four complete skeletons of the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) were found there, and it is of great interest to biospeleologists as three species of cave insects found there now bear the name \""Cres\"" in their Latin names. Among the attractions of Tramuntana, it's worth mentioning the sheep troughs used for watering the sheep, beautiful pastures, and labyrinths created in wide meadows with the aim of deepening the connection between Man and the Spirit of Nature. Five labyrinths of Tramuntana are modeled after well-known labyrinths from around the world and are dedicated to ancient nature and fertility deities: Vesna, Ishtar, Lada, Tara, and Rusalkas. The hiking trails in Tramuntana mostly follow the routes of old roads that once connected the villages and now connect these points of interest while passing through the beautiful nature full of wild orchids, butterflies, and aromatic herbs.

Whether you measure your love story in days, weeks, months or years, you will enjoy walking through the Love Path, exploring Crikvenica's 10 Kissing Spots, walking through the Mediterranean labyrinth of love ... Here you will also fin that special attention is directed toward pets, your friendly companions. So don't be surprised if you see a mut enjoying his very own doggy pint on the beach or feasting on some beach cake. In an area where the sun blissfully loves the sea, where tiny drops of well being spring from all around, it is easy to forget the time and let yourself go to a tide of positive energy. When you are in need of a blue-green hug, some nourishment for both body and soul, yearning for closeness to nature, the Crikvenica Riviera awaits as your most trusted friend, the one you are always

Whether your love story began yesterday or several decades ago, you will enjoy it! A promenade inspired by love stories... If you are a fan of long romantic walks, then you are definitely in the right place. The most beautiful promenade in the Crikvenica area, as many describe it, was created in the early 1930s, and due to the many loving gazes you can encounter there, it was named the Love Path. Along the 8 km long promenade, you will find a beautiful symbiosis of nature and cultural-historical heritage. It is an oasis where you will awaken your senses, whether you are gazing lovingly at your partner while holding hands, listening to the song of the wind, or enjoying the scent of Mediterranean herbs. Monty's Dog Beach and Bar It's never boring by the sea. Perhaps that's why this beach got its name - \""Poli mora\"". Here, fun almost never sleeps.

Or are you an active diver and summer is the perfect opportunity to explore the seabed? Whether you fall into one or the other category of tourist, exploring the underwater world is like entering a different realm where different rules apply.

Unfortunately, it is just a chert specimen of terrestrial origin, probably leftover construction material of the Cathedral, but interesting enough to inspire the imagination of the local people and their guests. Trace of Mozart in Đakovo After being appointed the bishop in Đakovo in 1806, Antun Mandić established a choir and small orchestra in the Cathedral, and the leader of that orchestra was the famous Viennese musician and composer Jakob Haibel, Mozart's brother-in-law. He stayed in Đakovo until his death, and at that time he composed 16 masses. It is little known that in 1806, Haibel got a small clavichord delivered to Đakovo, which was previously owned by Mozart. Haibel played this instrument and composed on it until his death on 24 March 1826. His widow Sofija put his private possessions up for sale and subsequently returned to Austria. The Three Gates of the Pavić Street The most famous legend from Đakovo was depicted in the ballad The Three Gates of the Pavić Street (Pavićanske tri kapije) which describes the town's Romeo and Juliet. These three gates lead to three houses that still exist, and were inhabited by employees of the diocese: winegrowers, with a relief of grape wines on the facade; woodsmen, symbolized by the oak leaves relief on the facade, and the third hose was inhabited by musicians, symbolized by the lyre relief on the facade. In one of the gates some hundred years ago a tragedy happened - a young man, probably head over heels in love, pulled a knife and ended his life during a romantic argument. To commemorate that tragic event, a sad ballad was made \""Pavićanske tri kapije\"". Eugen Nirjak and Mirko Kladarić recorded the earliest verses of that ballad, and the band Slavonske lole together with the singer Vera Svoboda recorded the song at the beginning of the 1990s and brought it back from oblivion. Đakovo, the home of the world''s greatest handball player Domagoj Duvnjak (born in Đakovo, 1 June 1988) is a Croatian professional handball player for the Croatian national team and for THW Kiel at the moment. His playing position is centre back. Domagoj has shown extraordinary talent from early childhood. When he was 14, Irfan Smajlagić invited him to play on the Cadet National Team. He won the European Champion title as a cadet in Estonia and was declared Championship Player. Playing for the Handball Club Đakovo (2004-2006), he made his debut in the 1st Croatian Handball League when he was 16. Two years later, he made the League's top scorer. His skill and results resulted in his transfer to the Handball Club Zagreb in 2006. He played for Zagreb for two years in European cups as a starter. From 2009 to 2014, Domagoj played for Handball Sport Verein Hamburg (Germany). He has been playing for German THW Kiel since 2014. He made his debut in a big senior cup at the World Championship 2007 in Germany, where Croatia was the fifth. Selector Lino Červar included him in the list for the European Championship in Norway in 2008, where he won his first big medal as a senior (silver). Handball-Planet declared Domagoj the World's Best Handball Player 2013. As the Captain of the Croatian National Team, Domagoj Duvnjak was declared the Most Valuable Player at the European Handball Championship 2020. Born in Đakovo, Domagoj promotes Đakovo, Slavonija and Croatia in the country and abroad with his sports successes, and promotes handball, of which we are very proud. Spend the weekend in the heart of Slavonia - Đakovo Đakovo offers an abundance of historical, cultural and natural sites, which can be seen in a day, but to really experience them, one needs to stay longer. Numerous religious buildings and cultural-historic monuments are located in the historical centre of Đakovo, which make the town recognizable and unique. The main street, Ulica pape Ivana Pavla II (Pope John Paul II Street), commonly known as Korzo, stretches from the St. Peter's Cathedral to the Church of All Saints. The town's core has kept its Art Noveau features which developed in the 18th and 19th century. This gives Đakovo its allure and shapes the visitors' experience, especially during nice weather when the main street becomes a promenade and a place for socializing, and the numerous cafes and patisseries located there invite to a break. Top 5 places you shouldn''t miss 1. St. Peters Cathedral 2. State Stud farm Đakovo 3. Wine cellar of Đakovo - Osijek Archdiocese 4. Museum of Đakovština and Memorial Museum of Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer 5. Church of All Saints Walk through the bishop''s city Museum of Đakovština and Memorial Museum of Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer The Museum of Đakovština was established in 1952, when the permanent exhibition was set up. The Museum's valuable collections include: the archaeological collection, the historic-cultural collection, the ethnographic collection, the numismatic collection, and the paintings gallery. The interior of the Museum's building is divided into studios, the permanent collection room, and a multi-purpose exhibition hall, which is currently the venue of the Museum's activities (exhibitions, workshops, book presentations, concerts, seminars, etc.). The back building, which has been in function since 2016, houses the library and depots and is the venue of different workshops. St. Peters Cathedral \""The church in Đakovo becomes its geographical location and it will remind our people of the divine purpose, which we, as the population of this part of Europe, are especially prompted to fulfil. This needs to be the quest of all our art...\"" Josip Juraj Strossmayer wrote in 1874, eight years after the beginning and eight years before the completion of the construction of the most important cultural monument in Đakovo, the most beautiful cathedral between Venice and Istanbul, as the famous the Good Pope John XXIII described it. State Stud farm Đakovo One of the most important and most durable symbols of Đakovo and the Đakovština area are horses, which have been bred for more than five centuries on the famous Stud Farm in Đakovo - now the State Stud Farm. Wine cellar of Đakovo - Osijek Archdiocese The beginnings of the winemaking and viticulture tradition of the Diocese Đakovo-Osijek can be traced back to the Pre-Ottoman period. After the liberation from the Turks, Bishop Petar Bakić restored the winemaking tradition by planting vineyards in Trnava, and Bishop Josip Čolnić expanded them. Bishop Antun Mandić established the vineyards in Mandićevac, on the slopes of Krndija, and Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer built the wine cellars in Trnava and Mandićevac.

It is located on the mild hills of Papuk, in the greenery of preserved nature and is one of the most beautiful cities in continental Croatia, which preserves a story longer than 2000 years. According to archeological finds, the life of people in the Daruvar area can be traced back to the Late Stone Age, but we get more complete picture of this area from the Roman period. At the time of the Roman Empire in this area there was a settlement of the native people of Jasa who lived next to the thermal springs of healing water. The name Jasa means \""\""the people of the spa or healers\""\"". The Romans built a settlement called Aquae Balissae on this site. Exactly around these springs of healing water, which you can also enjoy, Daruvar has developed as an oasis of peace and relaxation. Wines have been grown here for centuries and they are among the best in continental Croatia, and the wineries provide eno-gastronomic pleasure worthy of the Romans themselves or the famous Daruvar nobility. In this city, toasts are also made with top-quality beer, and the recipe and tradition of cooking and brewing beer were brought to this area by immigrant Czechs. Stomach problems, however, are treated with homemade plum brandy. Precisely on the tradition of wine, beer and brandy, some of the most famous events in Daruvar and nearby Sirač were created, which offer to every visitor a real rhapsody of flavors and aromas. Toasting with premium drinks and hanging out with loved ones are just some of the reasons to visit them. The name of the town hides the Hungarian name Crane town or Crane castle, as the noble count Antun Janković of Daruvar called it when he bought the property. This city will win you over with the greenery and beauty of its parks, the promenade along the river Toplica, the landscaped central square, the beautiful castle of the Janković family and its ever-living multiculturalism.
