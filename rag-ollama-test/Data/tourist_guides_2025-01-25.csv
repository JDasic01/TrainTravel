1,Babina Greda,Babina Greda,"Babina Greda is probably the best kept secret of eastern Croatia. The valleys are greener, the traditional kulen even more delicious, and the girls have the prettiest smiles. The Slavonian treasure chest will surprise you wherever you go. Gatherings of Stanari"" (Stanarski susreti) End of August (beginning of September) is reserve for the „Gatherings of Stanari"" („Stanarski susreti""). It's an event reviving sweet memories of life on traditional farms called ""stanovi"". You surely wonder what does term ""stan"" mean in the village of Babina Greda? It was a name for the house that was in a field close to a forest where local people would live through winter season and was like a second home. In addition to „stan"", there were other buildings where cattle was kept. Stan was always a few miles from the village. Visitors enjoy competition in disciplines connected to various farming skills, as well as the art preparing old dishes. When you get tired of woodwork, harnessing and shooting pumpkins, the aromas will lead you to a row of old wood stoves. There you will find hand-working local women who prepare all the food you have craved for years, but did not have an opportunity to taste. Since 2019. the Gatherings offer an additional attraction; cooking-duel between local women and food-bloggers and influencers. Who is better cook, what would you say?"

2,Bakar,Bakar Phenomena,"Weathering the Weather ‒ Forecast the Bakar Way On a sunny day, Bakar Bay appears as a safe haven. It's hard to imagine that the almost mirror-smooth surface of the sea can go wild. But find yourself in Bakar on a windy day, and you will experience the true power of nature. Bora (Cro. bura) is the name given to the unpredictable wind typical of the eastern Adriatic coast. It is a widely known wind. It is abrupt, fast, and comes in strong gusts. The saying goes that it is born in Senj, marries in Bakar, and dies in Trieste. And you know where the mood is the most raucous - at the wedding party! Thus, staying outside on the Bakar waterfront during the bora is almost unbearable. It is also an unusual experience when the bora wind finds you in the shelter of the streets of the old town. You can hear it coming, and you should stand against the wall so it doesn't knock you down on the way. The bora is indeed like a creature from folk tales."
2,Bakar,Gamified Tours,"Want to get to know Bakar and have a good time while doing it? Stop by the tourist office, pick up your ""Playful Bakar"" brochure and start exploring.

Whether you're a meat lover, seafood lover with a view of the sea, or a lover of excellent pizzas, you will be disappointed! Another name for a favorite Bakar snack is the Bakar baškot. This ring-shaped pastry used to sail the world with Bakar sailors, helping them quell their hunger on the journey. Baškots are very practical because of their shape and recipe. They could be tied up and hung, making it harder for mice on the ship to reach. Apart from that, when well-dried, they could heep for months, reminding the sailors of the tastes and scents of home. Today you can try them in the Bakar bakery „Bakarski Baškot,"" the so-called baškotarna, in their dried and contemporary, soft form."

2,Bakar,Sacred heritage,"If you want to spice up your tour with a touch of spirituality and mysticism, you should visit the Church of St. Andrew the Apostle. Built on the site where a church had existed since the 12th century, this monumental building received its present form at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries. At that time, it was the third largest church in Croatia! During the Ottoman invasions, it was the seat of the exiled bishops of Modruš, which is why the church has retained the status of a co-cathedral. Because of its acoustics, today this three-nave basilica with as many as nine altars is the favorite place of classical music performers. The Church of St. Andrew hides one more curiosity. There's an underground crypt beneath it! Also known as the ""catacombs,"" it has two corridors and eighty five graves in which priest and notable Bakar townspeople are buried. The crypt arouses curiosity not only in tourists, but also in archaeologists, historians, and other experts. The crypt hasn't been thoroughly researched, and it is possible it conceals unknown secrets from Bakar's past.  You can visit the crypt as part of  a guided tour of the town. For all information please contact info@tz-bakar.hr. Top 5 activities Climbing the winding streets of Bakar to the sleepy Frankopan Castle, you will feel the spirit of the past at every step.

Top 5 outdoor As we have already mentioned, the highest peak of Risnjak Mountain, one of the most beautiful national parks in Croatia, is located at the far northeastern point of the the town area. The 1,528-meter climb starts above Gornje Jelenje and takes about two hours. This experience is, as you might have guessed, unforgettable, and the view is well worth the effort. Tuhobić Mountain is also a wonderful sight, ideal for hikers and recreationists. The climb to its 1,109-meter high peak starts at the Plase railway station, located between Hreljin and Zlobin, or at Satničko, a popular picnic area. The village of Praputnjak, whose inhabitants are responsible for the creation, and in the 21st century for the restoration of the famous Bakarske Prezidi, is located in the Bakar hinterland. It found itself in its present location around 1730, since the newly constructed Karolina Road passed through it. With the arrival of the trade route, the settlement, which until then had consisted of a number of hamlets scattered around the fertile karst valley called Dolčina, clustered near the road and began to provide various services in addition to agriculture. To this day, all these events have remained inscribed in the landscape of Praputnjak and Dolčina, which is why the entire area was declared cultural heritage in the 1970s"
2,Bakar,Traces of the Past,"According to many, Frankopan Castle at the top of the old town of Bakar is the most striking monument of Bakar's cultural heritage. Proudly rising above the sea, the castle has witnessed centuries of historical turmoil, keeping a watchful eye over its town. Throughout the past, it was owned by the famous noble families Frankopan and Zrinski, while today it lives a new life sparking historical curiosity in new generations. Although located in the middle of an ancient Mediterranean town, this fascinating building, as its name suggests, was built in the Oriental style. It is believed to have been built in the 14th or the 15th century, but it remains unknown who built it and why. In the absence of historical facts about this site, let us highlight one of the many legends associated with it. According to the legend, Turkish House owes its Oriental look to love. The story goes that it was built by a sailor from Bakar so that his wife, whom he had brought from Constantinople, would feel more comfortable and closer to her homeland during her beloved's long absences at sea."
2,Bakar,Events,"The most famous and popular event in Bakar is undoubtedly Margareta's Summer aka Margaretino Leto. Inspired by the celebration of the feast of St. Margaret (July 13th), the patron saint of Bakar, Margaretino leto has been held in Bakar for 30 years! During its forty days (end of June - beginning of August), visitors are attracted by events that offer something for everyone - a bit of entertainment, a bit of culture, a bit of interesting walking tours, and, finally, a heap of feel-good emotions. If you happen to be in Kvarner region during the summer months, be sure to visit Bakar as well. You won't regret it! Bakar would not be an old Kvarner town if it didn't have a carnival! As elsewhere in the northern Adriatic, carnival brings a lot of positive energy, creativity, and good mood to the Bakar region. Carnival associations organize masquerade dances and carnival processions for children, while the most impressive event is certainly the parade of Zvončari (""bellmen"") called ""Bells and Carols of the Bakar"" (Cro. „Zvona i kanat za bakarski kraj""). In short, Bakar is the place to be at the beginning of the year!"

3,Bale-Valle,Bale-Valle,"Located exactly half way between the Equator and the North Pole, the romantic and picturesque municipality of Bale is a true representation of good life and Istrian tradition."
3,Bale-Valle,Bale - Town Hotel,"The pearl that is Bale already almost operates as a Hotel town. The vision of the county's development has been encompassed in a study purposely made so that Bale does not develop uncontrollably in the future. The aim of its inhabitants is for the entire town to function as a hotel in the future. There will be a reception at the town's entrance. Its fabulous white stone streets will be the hotel's halls. The legendary Casanova used to walk these magnificent streets. It has recently been discovered that he had visited Bale on two occasions, in 1743 and 1744 to see a young lady from the Soardo family. He surely felt the beauty and the charm of this ancient town. Bale is getting ready to become a town hotel for real. The cooperation of accommodation owners, caterers and other tourism workers creates the prerequisites for it. The brand Bale encompasses all the participants in the touristic offer. The offer that satisfies the strict criteria will be a part of the trademark - and guarantees not only quality but the participation in the Bale tourism story which needs to be experienced, not only told."
3,Bale-Valle,Butterflies,Fairytale Creatures - The district of Bale - a district of butterflies. A butterfly is featured on Bale's coat of arms. This clean and pristine area is home to 390 species of butterfly. Many species of those fairy tale creatures are endangered and legally protected and they can be encountered only in a few places in the world. If you decide to visit Bale make sure you bring your camera with you and maybe you will get a chance to immortalise the flight of one of those beautiful creatures. You will almost certainly come across butterflies on our biking and trekking tracks.
3,Bale-Valle,Castle Soardo Bembo,"The Soardo - Bembo palace, the largest building in Bale, catches the attention of every visitor with the beauty of its renovated gothic- renaissance facade. The castle was built at the beginning of the 16th century as a representable residential palace placed between two towers as part of town walls. It belonged to the Soardo family up until Veronica Soardo married Alvise Bembo in 1618. The palace, then, changed owners. During reconstruction, objects from a Bronze Age settlement were found in the basements. It was included on the list of 30 most important monuments in Croatia and was completely refurbished in 2012.  Almost 2 million euros were invested in its reconstruction. The money was received through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Italian union and the National University of Triest. It is today the headquarters of the Italian community of Bale. The exhibition of the most beautiful Venetian costumes the community owns is displayed on the first floor. The castle is open for public."
3,Bale-Valle,Dinosaur,"When some bones were found on the sea bed in Bale in 1992 nobody realised how important the discovery really was. It was a 'discovery of the century'. The bones retrieved from the sea were in fact dinosaur bones. It has been estimated that at least ten dinosaur species lived in this area. One of them is the Brachiosaurus, one of the largest dinosaurs ever to roam the earth whose weight reached 30 tons and could grow to be up to 25 metres long. This discovery put Bale in the World List of Paleontological Sites. Bale's site, as far as it is known, is the only find in the world that has dinosaur remains under the sea. It is believed that some of the bones are 200 million years old. Make sure you visit Bale and the MMC ""Ulika"" whose showcases encompass the bones of these huge animals, touch the footprints and remains of these remarkable creatures that used to rule the world."
3,Bale-Valle,Forts - Kazamate,"The Forts - Kazamate were built between 1898 and 1914. They belong to the most preserved examples of 19th and 20th Centuries defensive architecture. They occupy about 150 hectares of the shoreline area and are connected with a network of dirt tracks. The forts Monformo, San Benedetto, Calluzi, Paravia-east, Paravia-west and Paravia Barracks are unique fortified complexes. During the excavation many other items were found, parts of carpentry, metal works..."
3,Bale-Valle,Homesteads,"Beautifully rural scenery, dominated by forests, olive groves, fields, vineyards and orchards reign in the District of Bale's interior. There are about eighty homesteads in the area, called stancije in Istria. Stancije used to be family run affairs and we plan to revitalise about forty stancije in the area in order to give a special identity to Bale's interior. One already renovated stancija, known for producing olive oil and wines of the highest quality points the way ahead, and there is no doubt that stancije can offer pleasure and creature comforts in a pristine environment to tourists."
3,Bale-Valle,Lapidary - Crypt,"When the parish church of Visitation of Blessed Virgin Mary to St. Elizabeth was being built, many items of material heritage were carefully stored in the crypt. The crypt has a lapidary which protects many stone and archaeological sculptures and fragments of decorative stone plastic. Liturgical furniture of a locality in the vicinity of Bale (St Mary, St Mary, San Polo) from ancient times to late medieval times is also part of the crypt's treasure. The stone sarcophagus with the remains of Blessed Julian patron saint of Bale from 1595 is also kept in the crypt. His remains were transferred in 1755 to a new reliquary in the church. There's a panel from 1645 above the sarcophagus which used to mark the spot at the St Michael's monastery where the saint's body was found."
3,Bale-Valle,Paleontological exhibition DINOSAURUS HISTRIAE,"The MMC ""Ulika"" had already in its first year of activity received the famous Istrian tourism board award ""Zlatna koza - Capra d'oro"" (Golden goat) due to its extraordinary way of presentation. Bones of Sauropodus i.e. dinosaurs which lived on Earth more than 200 million years ago are being held in the showcases of the gallery. The bones were found at the sea bottom in Colone bay in 1992 then cleaned and stuffed in the Paleontological museum in Monfalcone. As far as we know, the site in Bale is the only site that keeps fossilized dinosaur remains under water. That is the reason Bale were included on the list of World paleontological sites."
3,Bale-Valle,Ornithological collection,"Take a little time and see different bird species and listen to their singing in MMC ""Ulika"". The exhibition is developed on various levels. Stuffed birds collected by Pietro Sassaro through decades in Bale, Rovinj, Palud and surroundings are exhibited in showcases. He studied them meticulously, stuffed them and made this collection today especially valuable. We have taken the effort to describe each bird and add its authentic singing. We assure you, it is very interesting... Descriptions of birds in PDF format ( 38 MB ) Authentic sings in MP3 format (57 MB)"
3,Bale-Valle,Old Town Core,"The old town core of Bale is a special urban whole built within the walls of the fort, and it has a protected status as most of the buildings within it. Most of the squat looking houses are built of stone and are connected by stone - paved alleys. The old town core, with its castle Soardo Bembo and a number of religious structures like the parish Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary's Homage to Saint Elizabeth and the crypt offers a special atmosphere to those living in Bale as well as to Bale's visitors. It is a real luxury spending your vacation here - stone houses bleached by the bora wind, shadowy shelters of the wines above entrances, terraces and porches as well as streets with stone benches are a perfect beginning for your dream vacation. Olive, Wines and Cheese The tourist card of Bale would not be complete without the agricultural dimension. The area of Bale is a real treasure throve of indigenous sorts of olives as well as other symbols of healthy food and traditional ecological agriculture and quality wines and cheeses. Bale's olive oils, for the most part produced from the indigenous Buza but also from other sorts of olives form an inevitable part of all the prestigious publications dealing with olive oils. Bale's olive oils have also received many awards and prizes. This should come as no surprise in the light of the fact that olives have been grown in this area since Roman times. Thirty centuries of the olive growing tradition has given birth to a legend claiming that travellers could negotiate the way from the town to the shore, a distance of seven kilometres, hopping from one olive to the next without touching the ground at all. Bale's citizens want to share the beauty of their olive groves and in future it will be possible to stroll down an olive path and all those who want to enjoy the charms of olive picking will be able to indulge in that joy in the olive groves there. In the desire to give an additional boost to olive growing in the district the planting and growing of olives is actively encouraged. Even though Bale's citizens traditionally do not grow olives for commercial purposes many typical Istrian vines can be found in the area - Malvasia and Istrian Teran. These wines will always go down well with Bale's cheeses and homemade Istrian cuisine - something that lacks not at all in Bale. There is no rush in Bale, so we suggest all those who lead a stressful life to stop and enjoy the scents of aromatic herbs. The scent of sage, immortelle, rosemary, lavender and many other plants is spreading through Bale and its surroundings and the only thing you have to do is take a deep breath - it will relax your body and soul."
3,Bale-Valle,San-Polo - Colone - Paravia Site,"The remains of an ancient villa rustica and medieval church of Saint Paul are located in the Saint Paul (San Polo) lagoon, by the camp of the same name. This is an archaeological zone where one can see the remains of ancient structures (walls, rooms, presses). There is a small promontory close to the church, believed to be a remnant of architecture of undetermined date. Bale's Shoreline Bale's shoreline is a pristine part of Istria's coast, without big hotels and other buildings. The shoreline is nine kilometres long, surrounded by exceptionally clean sea. Down by the sea you are not too far away to smell the scent of Mediterranean vegetation, which grows there in abundance. Located in the west of Istria Bale's shoreline boasts a magnificent view of the Brijuni islands, and its sunsets will, surely, forever grace your memory. The shoreline area is rich in archaeological sites, and one can also find remains of old roads, parts of Roman villas and oil presses and there is also a magnificently preserved fortification complex from the Dual Monarchy period. On this really pristine shoreline, only seven kilometres from Bale are the San Polo and Colone camps. They stretch along some ten kilometres of Bale's shoreline and have a sewage system and tap water. The camps also have mobile homes for rent. The camps are being managed by Mon Perin ltd. This is a special Bale story,too. Mon Perin has been founded in 2005 by citizens of Bale, the county of Bale and its friends. At the beginning the company had 740 stakeholders and a share capital worth 12 million kunas. It is today worth around 30 million kunas, while the company counts more than 900 stakeholders. Since the people of Bale decided not to sell their land, Mon Perin got the land where the camps are to manage for 50 years. The shoreline will retain its pristine condition in the future because it has been decided that the distance from the sea to the nearest accommodation facilities will be about 700 metres, which is a reflection of wishes and visions of those who manage the town of Bale and, by extension, of all those who live in the district. They all work towards a common goal - to develop Bale in harmony with the environment and they will not falter in that determination. Furthermore, that determination has been replicated into all the pertinent documents regarding Bale's future development."
3,Bale-Valle,Stancija,"Beautifully rural scenery, dominated by forests, olive groves, fields, vineyards and orchards reign in the District of Bale's interior. There are about eighty homesteads in the area, called stancije in Istria. Stancije used to be family run affairs and we plan to revitalise about forty stancije in the area in order to give a special identity to Bale's interior. One already renovated stancija, known for producing olive oil and wines of the highest quality points the way ahead, and there is no doubt that stancije can offer pleasure and creature comforts in a pristine environment to tourists."
3,Bale-Valle,Town Hall,"A beautiful loggia was built in the 14th century on the square paved with stone outside the city walls in front of the Town Hall, which was considerably altered in the 19th century. It was reconstructed in neogothic style with an elegant porch entrance. Various crests are built in the porch, amongst them the crest of the county of Bale - a white cross in a red surface. The town's administration apparatus is housed in the Town Hall today. It also keeps the statute that Venice Republic ratified in 1477. Statuto del Comun de Avalle Bale is called castel de Valle, or Comun de Valle. Venice Republic gave to Bale the status of town on 16th November 1332, calling it terra Vallis or commune de terre Vallis."
5,Baranja,Baranja,"At first sight, Baranja is covered in lush landscapes and idyllic villages, framed by the Danube and Drava rivers and the magical scenery of the Kopački Rit Nature Park. Once you enter its world of secrets, you will be delighted by ancient stories, flavours from your childhood, and the warmth around you."
5,Baranja,Baranja - Mother of wine,"A visit to Baranja cannot pass without a tour of the wine roads, surduks and gatorsand this will be advised by every Baranja man and every person who has been to Baranja at least once. Their story would certainly begin around the so-called """"Baranja mountains"""" or Banovo hill. The hill was initially called the Golden Hill, or Mons Aureus, by the ancient Romans, and then the Habsburg court gave the name Goldberg. Yes, it was the Habsburgs who drank Baranja wines, but this is not their only connection with Baranja, more in another story. You can already see the real wine experience that awaits you in Baranja. In addition, Baranja comes from the Hungarian words bor - wine and anya - mother which means mother of wine. Baranja tourists start their wine adventure by driving through endless vineyards, and this is the reason why Baranja is nicknamed by some as """"little Tuscany"""". Some even say that the appearance of Baranja vineyards can be compared to those in France. But the drops they produce are also worthy of a French bottle. In any case, more than 1,000 hectares of this """"green sea"""" leave no one indifferent, and make the people of Baranja extremely proud. Wine culture is passed down from generation to generation. In some wineries, the 5th generation currently produces their wines according to the recipe of their grandfathers, but with a drop of modern taste.. Winemaking has become very popular among young people, so there are more and more young producers, especially female producers. That's right, this is another interesting wine fact. In Baranja, almost every wine cellar has its own female wine producer or oenologist. Go on a wine tour of Baranja and become a real hedonist. Most of them are daughters of winemakers who inherited knowledge and skills from their fathers and grandfathers, but also wine lovers who stand shoulder to shoulder with famous Croatian (male) oenologists. Numerous wine cellars, the so-called gators who preserve world-renowned wines are proof that Baranja region is mother of wine. Such wine cellars, unique in the world, are buried in Banovo hill, providing the same temperature throughout the year, which makes them suitable for storing wine.. Built more than a century ago, today they are a real tourist attraction. And the unique experience of drinking wine in these cellars will surely remain in your memory forever. The most famous gators are located in the villages of Suza and Zmajevac, while the largest wine cellar in this part of Europe, but also the oldest in Baranja, is located in Kneževi Vinogradi, the one of the Belje winery. Baranja surduk are roads and streets cut through the hill, some created as natural gullies, and some by human hands. The most famous are those in Zmajevac and they are the ones who hide and hide numerous cellars (so-called gators). Take a tour of the gator and surduk on foot or by bike, because today, in addition to wine, you can find restaurants and even accommodations that offer a unique experience."
5,Baranja,Wine - Bor marathon,"The Wine Bor Marathon is designed to promote the economic, tourist and cultural offer of Osijek-Baranja County, with an emphasis on its strongest brand - wine and the rural / gastronomic offer of the entire county. The three-day event offers locals and visitors a rich program - creative workshops, fairs, performances by folklore ensemble from Croatia and other countries, concerts, exhibitions, plays, competitions and wine evaluations, and a rich gastronomic offer accompanied by quality wines. The first day of the event is held under the name """"Premium Wine Marathon"""". This day is intended for people who do not like crowds and are fans of intimate gatherings with top wines. Namely, on Fridays, only wines that have at least 83 points from a rating are poured, or if the Decision on the release of wine states the number of points (minimum 80) due to the labeling of wine with the traditional term QUALITY / TOP WINE The Wine Marathon program starts on the second day at 12:00 with an ethno fair, an international folklore festival, and an entertaining part before the START. The main event of this event is the Wine Competition, a unique wine event where competitors (marathoners) find Zmajevac cellars and evaluate the wines of local winemakers. Very few people finish a marathon on their own because they are simply sorry to do it mechanically and quickly. They usually stop at a point where there is a good team and atmosphere, and anchors there. Everyone wants the wine magic to last as long as possible and deliberately postpone or bypass the end points of the marathon. And the fun with the sounds of timeless songs in one of the gators always lasts until the early morning hours. The third day is planned for the Days of Open Cellars in Baranja, when visitors, who may have liked a wine, can visit each of the winemakers from the Wine Marathon and stock up on fine drops of wine. Name? The wine marathon is clear to everyone, but what does bor mean? 80% of the population of Zmajevac is of Hungarian nationality, so we respected multiculturalism in the name of the event. Bor in Hungarian means wine. Why marathon? When the contestant registers, he gets a map, a glass, a glass holder around his neck, a T-shirt and vouchers for wine consumption in the cellars, which are marked on the map. What is important is that the wine roads (surduci) are marked with colors, the marathoner starts on the wine road what color is his T-shirt and glasses. They all tour the same cellars, they just don't start in the same cellar because the winemakers wouldn't be able to handle that crowd. But if there was no time limit it would be just a tour of the basement. The marathoner should visit 20-27 cellars within 5 hours on a 5.8-kilometer route in 3 surduks on the Zmajevačka wine road. Each contestant gets 1 dl of wine to exchange vouchers, you have to guess the type of wine and write it on a map, and evaluate the quality, then you get a stamp or signature from the winemaker and the marathoner can go to the next station."
6,Barban,Barban,"Barban is a small historical town situated at the plateau separating Labinština and Puljština. Ancient Romans once inhabited these pre-historic fortifications. Throughout history, Barban was also known for its strategic position, dominating over the hill and ruling the valley and the bridge over the Raša river. With the passing of time, the town transformed into a fortress surrounded by walls, round and square towers, ramparts, large and small gates, and a castle. The Loredans, a Venetian noble family, purchased it from the counts of Pazin in 1535. Although they stayed in Barban only periodically, the members of the family, represented by their captain, tore down the old castle and erected a palace and St. Nicholas parish church in its place. Located in front of the large gates is a small stone church from the 15th century dedicated to Anthony the Great, its interior covered in frescos. The most prominent resident of Barban is priest Pietro Stancovich (1771-1852), author of ""Biografia degli uomini distinti dell'Istria"", depicting the lives of 478 prominent Istrian persons. Nowadays, Barban is famous for its knights' game, the ""Trka na prstenac"" race, as well as its wine festival and fig festival."
8,Baška,Archaeological sites and museums,"Explore the ruins of mighty fortresses and ancient chapels that once provided the spiritual and physical needs of the inhabitants. Visit the museums where exhibits from past times offer a glimpse of the life of Baška. St. Mark Chapel excavation site St. Mark is located close to Vela Plaža. It is a small chapel, modest in appearance and at first glance not much different than typical village churches dotting the Adriatic islands and seaside settlements. But this particular chapel hides a rare and very interesting find beneath its foundations. Twin basilicas that once stood there are a 1500-year-old marvel of sacral architecture. Christian symbolism is most clearly visible in the cross-shaped floorplan of the larger, northern basilica, as well as in the cross-shaped baptistery and baptismal font, marking it quite unique for the early Christian period. The mosaic tiled floor has been only partially uncovered, but even such it shows the exquisite craftsmanship and grandeur of a monument equal to the greatest Christian churches."
8,Baška,Castum Corinthia,"The undistirbed serenity of Krk that we know today can easily be taken for granted. However, our ancestors lived in very different times. Those were the times when pirates roamed freely along the waters of Kvarner Bay, bent on pillage and presenting a constant danger to the inhabitants of Kvarner bay populace. Mighty forts, built on the easily defensible natural positions were the safe-keepers of common folk and the guardians of sea lanes. One prime example of such is the Corinthia Castrum, an early Byzantine fort built on the Sokol peninsula, nestled between the mighty mountain ranges and the shore. The fort's purpose was to gard two important bays - Vela Luka and Mala Luka, the nearby settlment, and the rich fertile soil of the Bosar lowlands. Accessible only from the sea, Corinthia was a mighty deterrent to any hostiles foolish enough to wade into its range and made the life, even in those troubled times, that much safer. Visiting its ruins today will let you immerse yourself deeply in history and picture the life of these parts as it was centuries ago, if only for a brief moment."
8,Baška,Locality Mira bear Jurandvor,"A three-nave church dating to 5th century is a recent arcaeological find you may wish to discover during your visit.

Defiant inhabitants refused to give in to the demands of the mighty Republic and the town with its castle paid the price. Visit the picturesque hilltop ruins and the nearby Church of St. John with the cemetery and witness the towns origins firsthand. Looking at the site and the surroundings makes it easy to imagine the long gone times and former might of Frankopans."

8,Baška,About the Glagolitic script,"It is thanks to the Glagolitic that the Croatian language persevered while foreign rulers took turns ruling Croatia and tried to enforce the use of their own respective languages to the population. Ever since St. Cyrill created it in the 9th century, Glagolitic script, the oldest Slavic alphabet has taken root and began to appear in various texts, slowly replacing Latin. Its primary purpose might have been to spread the Christianity more easily among the local populace, but on Krk, Glagolitic alphabet quickly found its way into public documents, even as other parts of Croatia still remained faithful to Latin. Literature, legends, novels, and legal documents were also written in Glagolitic, preserving and solidifying Croatian culture and heritage. Baška Tablet and Glagolitic script This is the site where Baška tablet, one of the most important finds of Croatian heritage was found, entirely by accident. The 800 kg limestone, one meter in height and two in width might not quite have the importance of the Rosetta stone, but the markings on it are nevertheless extremely significant for Croatian history. It was in 1851 that young priest by name of Peter Dorčić stumbled upon this rare and immensely valuable find. The lay hidden in the church pavement since the beginning of the 12th century. Originally it was a part of the church septum (altar rail) along with another inscribed tablet, of which only parts were found. It took 24 years to fully translate the text written on the tablet and its content proved to be invaluable, proving the existence of a Croatian sovereign at the time of its creation. It explained how Croatian king Dmitar Zvonimir donated the land to the church of St. Lucy to the local Benedictine monastery. This was the first known instance of a Croatian name being written in Croatian language with the use of Croatian Glagolitic script. When visiting the church today, you will see the copy of the famous tablet, as the original is displayed in Zagreb, in the Academy of Science and Art. Nevertheless, it is a remarkable sight and a place you just have to visit. Baška Glagolitic Alphabet Trail If you wish to find out more about the glagolitic script and the history of this region as well as Croatia, there is no better way than to take a stroll on the Glagolitic trail. It is an outdoor route, a kind of an open air museum showcasing natural beauty of the landscape and Croatian heritage. Perfect for families but equally enjoyable alone or with a group of friends. In around two hours, you will discover 34 stone sculptures with engraved Glagolitic letters. The route will take you from the Treskavac pass to Draga Bašćanska and Jurandvor, then along Sv.

8,Baška,Culture,"The Baška Tablet The Baška Tablet is one of the most precious Croatian monuments. It dates to around AD 1100, but it was brought to the national attention only in 1851 thanks to the initiative of Pastor Petar Dorčić. It was originally the left partition panel in the stone railing that separated the congregation from the altar in the nave of the Benedictine Church of St. Lucy in Jurandvor. Its historical value and significance is mainly associated with the language and the script it contains: indeed, it is the oldest known document in which a Croatian name is written in the Croatian language and in the Croatian Glagolitic script. Since 1934 the Baška Tablet has been preserved in the building of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts; the one on display at the church of St. Lucy in Jurandvor is thus a replica."

This was not always so, as Stražica lighthouse was once home to its crew, but the advents of solar-powered batteries meant that presence was no longer required. The second first is the fact that Prvić is the windiest island in Croatia, enduring the stormy Bura winds over 200 days a year. This might make it a bit unsuitable for human dwellings, but benefits of this salty clear wind on the islands flora and fauna are many. Riding along its shore on the tourist boat from Baška, you will notice the gorgeous reddish purple, and grey hues of the island.

8,Baška,The Multicellular Sheepfolds,"Dry stone walls are built using the ancient technique, by laying cut stones without any mortar to bind them together.

The closest one is Bunculuka, located near the nudist camp, with the limestone cliff towering above the sea. This was the first climbing spot on Krk and is still very popular among enthusiasts. It offers ten routes and a maximum height of 15 meters. The second one is Portafortuna (The Luckbringer), just about 10 kilometres away, between Draga Baščanska and Punat. This cliff offers routes for all skill levels, with the highest one covering 30 meters. The third, also located between Draga Baščanska and Punat, you will find Belove Stene, the highest climbing area on Krk, leading up to the Obzova peak. Even as the cliff offers shade throughout most of the day, we recommend an early visit to avoid the summer sun on the 30-minute hike to the destination. Finally there is Bag, the newest climbing spot, located close to the namesake peak, just about 30 minutes walking distance from Vela Plaža beach. Reach the top to enjoy a superb view of Prvić island and Vela Plaža."
8,Baška,Zip line,"Time to discover some of the nicest Krk landscapes from a completely different perspective, whooshing above the treeline at a speed of up to 80 kilometres per hour. The famous canopy tour has all the makings of an unforgettable adventure. Best of all, no family member needs to be excluded, from youngest to the eldest. Lasting just short of two hours, it will take you on a jeep ride to the starting point, just off the A letter monolith Glagolitic path, and then across the lines strewn above the landscape."
8,Baška,Water Sports,"The usual offer of recliners, parasols, snacks, and refreshments will make for a fine day at the beach, but when you desire a more thrilling experience, it is easy to find a rental and go for a jet boat or jet ski ride across the azure waters of the Adriatic. For a more relaxing experience, rent a pedal boat, a kayak or a SUP board at the beach and cast off for a couple of hours. Spice up your beach day with parasasailng, a jolt of adrenaline mixed with a relaxing, transcendental feeling of soaring through the air, high above the ground. When the northern bura (bora) wind starts to blow, Baška becomes a prime wind surfing spot in an instant. Hurry and grab your surf board and go brave the wind in a thrilling ride."
8,Baška,Outdoor adventures,Get that heart rate up and spend an active holiday in Baška with a great offer of activities and a picture perfect view.
8,Baška,Outdoor adventures,"Path to the moon & Moon plateau Reaching the moon does not require rigorous astronaut training, a NASA spacecraft and a Houston control centre. At least not when you are in Baška. Instead of a spacesuit, don your hiking boots, fill your backpack with ice-cold water and remember to bring a lot of sunscreen. Many wonders lay straight ahead of you. The most interesting hiking and biking trail around Baška is without a doubt the Path to the Moon. This entirely man-made trail through the inhospitable rocky country is a testament to the persistence of the locals. The trail is somewhat demanding and offers plenty of shade under the pines and each brief stop you make offers gorgeous views of Baška and the shoreline so make sure to bring your camera with you. Your reward for braving the moon trail is finally here. Reaching the highest peak — the 471-meter high Diviška, and 461-meter high Hlam gaze upon the impossible array of colours of the island, the shore, and the archipelago beneath you. Hiking through the rocky and at first glance barren landscape that gave the Moon plateau its name, you will start spotting its many wonders."
8,Baška,Mrgari,"The panoramic view of Krk is the most obvious one, as are the health benefits of spending some time outdoors. But within the rocky desert, you will soon see flocks of sheep, grazing inside dry stone-walled pens, locally known as mrgari. These flower-shaped pens can be found only in a handful of places in the whole world (Island and Wales, UK). They were used to separate the flocks of different owners ever since men first tamed this land."
8,Baška,Bag peak,"A lovely hiking opportunity you might want to seize during your stay is the semicircular route leading from Baška beach to Bag peak promontory. Set on a cliff 250 meters above sea level it will treat you to a view opening up on the bay of Baška, Vela Plaža, and Prvić island. A lovely mrgar called Ljubimer is nearby, so make sure you visit it if you decide to hike up to Bag. The most probable theory about the origin of the name Baška is that it is derived from the name of Bag peak. If the mountain is Bag, the valley beneath it would be called Baška valley that gave the name to the town. Kuntrep & Diviška Kuntrep is the oldest ornithological reserve in the world, dating back to 1969. Spanning the shoreline from cape Glavina to Mala Luka bay, it is approximately 10 kilometres by 1 kilometre in size. Many birds found their home on its steep cliffs jutting into the Adriatic sea. The most famous is the Griffon vulture, but many other majestic, endangered European birds can be seen here as well, such as Short-toed eagle, Peregrine falcon, and European shag. The reserve is reachable only by foot or by a boat, but let this not be a deterrent for an inspiring field trip. You will get a chance to observe some of the most glorious birds of prey, clinging to life in the harshest of environments. This is also a great opportunity to combine your exploration with seeing the mrgari, as these unusual and beautifully constructed sheep pens border the reserve on its highest part. Then there is the Diviška lokva — a pond divided by dry stone walls into five parcels owned by five families as an extension of their pastures, where sheep come to quench their thirst. The pond is a part of Kuntrep ornithological reserve."
8,Baška,Grebenski put,"Considered by many to be the most beautiful hiking trail on Krk, Grebenski put leads from Baška to Treskavac saddle, crossing the peak of Veli Vrh The grassy part of Grebenski put is easy on the feet, while the rest of the way is strewn with rocks and boulders and a bit more demanding. The entire trail is dotted with amazing lookout spots of the surrounding countryside and the sea. No matter if you are visiting during the height of summer or the middle of winter, this is one inspiring outdoor adventure you should undertake."
8,Baška,Educational trail,"If you are spending your time in Baška with your kids, there is a beautiful idea for an outdoor day you should strive to fit into your schedule. A stroll along the educational trail will take you through some of the most fascinating areas in the vicinity, brimming with tradition, history, and natural beauty. The trail starts at Zarok village near Baška, where you will see the unique Zarok sandy area. It then follows the flow of Vela Rika river, the only natural flowing watercourse on Krk, and leads to Batomalj, a charming village with a rich heritage. After that, the path continues toward the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Gorica, taking you to the restored Mrgar (flower-shaped dry stone wall sheep pens) Lipica. Along the trail, you will get a chance to discover many fragrant and some endemic plant species, see and hear the local wildlife, and experience the immense natural beauty of the Mediterranean setting. The route is just 6 kilometres long and not very demanding, making it perfect for a family outing on a balmy, bright day."
8,Baška,Cycling,"One of the best and healthiest ways to discover the Southern part of Krk island is by hopping on a bicycle and following one of the many interesting routes. Pedal your way through some of the most beautiful parts of Krk, see the sights, feel the atmosphere and have fun. Apart from the bicycle — your personal ride or the one rented in one of the shops in Baška, consider the appropriate clothing, depending on the season of your visit. Weather in Croatia is generally mild, but coastal areas can be somewhat fickle, especially when the trademark northern/north-eastern wind called bura (bora) starts to blow. Discover many interesting cycling trails of this part of the island, such as a family friendly 11 km route leading from Zarok to Draga Baščanska, the demanding 24 km uphill trail to the Moon plateau, offering spectacular views aroud each of its bends, or the short but demanding 11km long Portafortuna trail with many single trails. Whichever you choose, don't forget your camera, as there will be sights you will want to show to your friends and family when you return. For those who don't like to venture out and discover on their own Bike Center Baška and Zen Adventures both offer a wide range of organized tours, where you will travel with fellow enthusiasts and an expert guide."
8,Baška,Diving,"Kvarner bay is a known spot frequently visited by divers and enthusiasts from all around the world. Much of it is due to the incredibly clean sea of the northern Adriatic and the terrain configuration that hides many underwater caves, cliffs, coves, and inlets teeming with life. Among all this choice, Baška diving spots take a special place, no matter if you are a seasoned veteran or an absolute beginner. If you are up to an adventure, participate in a night dive, go exploring, dive from the shore or from a boat and explore the wonders hiding below the Adriatic surface. We recommend visiting the Squatina diving centre in Baška as their guided tours will take you to the prime spots not easily discovered on your own. Beginner and advanced courses will allow you to brush up on your skills and brave the depths with grace and ease."
8,Baška,At the beach,"The usual offer of recliners, parasols, snacks, and refreshments will make for a fine day at the beach, but when you desire a more thrilling experience, it is easy to find a rental and go for a jet boat or jet ski ride across the azure waters of the Adriatic.

8,Baška,The Church of St Lucy,"When you venture inland from Baška, you will come upon village of Jurandvor and, among its peaceful homes, the church os St. Lucy, as well as an arcaheological site with the ruins of ancient villa and a monastery surrounding it. One of the most famous churches of Krk island also has a special signicance for Croatian history, as Baška tablet was discovered here. The exact date when Benedictine abbey and the church of St. Lucy were erected in Jurandvor is not known, but we can deduct from the text of Baška tablet that they have existed since the early 12th century. A Romanesque Catholic church is best known for the Baška tablet, but there is another significant detail hidden in its bell tower - the first known instance of the checkerboard pattern of Croatian coat of arms. If you visit Jurandvor on the 13th of December, on the Feast of Saint Lucy, you will have a chance to witness a very old tradition, known as the throwing hlipcić (a small loaf of bread). Many centuries ago, the church operated a watermill nearby. Flour produced here was then given to the locals to bake bread, which was then thrown from the belltower after the mass, to the faithful gathered in the courtyard. It is a lovely tradition, that endures to this day."
8,Baška,The Church of Our Lady of Gorica,"Did you know that Krk has its own Camino route, one that is about to become an official part of the pilgrimage routes of St. Jacob? One of the important stops on the trail, just before it takes us uphill to the Obzova peak is The Church of Our Lady of Gorica. Ever since the 16th century, it has been visited by pilgrims and the faithful from all over Krk island. Legend has it, that the original church built in the 11th century near Batomalj was under constant threat of pirate raids. The angels themselves took notice and came to the aid of local villagers. They took the statue of the Madonna and placed it on the hilltop, far from the reach of the would-be looters. The grateful locals then built a new church here, naming it fittingly - the Church of our Lady of Gorica. The way to the sanctuary will take you through the beatiful nature and sets the mood perfectly. It leads along the walled meadows where sheep and donkeys graze peacefully and stream over a stone brige you will come upon a staircase with 237 stone stairs, polished by the sun and the multitude of feet that climbed it since its creation in the late 19th century. Pilgrims from all over the world follow The Way of the Cross here, visiting the Stations made of broze. In especially difficult times throughout history, the faithful carried the statue of Our Lady of Gorica on their shoulders in a procession from Baška to the sanctuary. The Church of St. John The Old Man is a moniker given to the church bell chiming solemnly from the belltower of St. John since 1431. St. John stands upon a hilltop where the heart of Baška was located in the antiquity.The church thus once cast its benevolent and protective shadow on the town and the faithful. Throughout the centuries, the town gradually grew and developed into the plain and the coast. Built in the 11th century, St. John was originally an imposing Romanesqua style edifice with no less than seven altars. A parish church until the middle of the 18th century, it was abandoned a century later, as the town migrated from the hill toward the coast. However, it was restored in 1855, after a cholera outbreak subsided. While visiting the church, take a stroll through the graveyard surrounding it and enjoy the most beautiful view of Baška and surrounding villages, as well as Prvić and Rab islands. Many of the renowned Baška residents found their resting place here. Arguably the most famous is Emil Geistlich, one of the founders of tourism in Baška."
8,Baška,Parish Church of the Holy Trinity,"Built in the end of 18th century at a more convenient location as the locals moved from the hills closer to the shore, Holy Trinity became the parish church of Baška. A Baroque three naved edifice with a 28 meter bell tower remained in its original form until the 20th century, when the facade was completely reshaped in the eclectic style featuring beige tones and ornamentations. During your visit to this lovely historic and sacral monument, discover the main altar adorned with a painting by local master named Fran Jurić. It depicts the Holy Trinity and the coronation of the Virgin Mary."

Šurlice or Valcići Once upon a time, a feast, celebration or any major event was unimaginable without a healthy serving of dishes prepared with homemade pasta called šurlice or as they known in Baška - valcići. On those big days, local girls and women gathered in large groups and prepared šurlice by coiling the thinly rolled pasta sheets around wooden knitting needles. Folk songs were sung, diligent hands were kept busy for hours on end, and the result was a 5 centimetres long pastry, hollowed in the middle, and absolutely delicious. Not so much a part of the tradition of these parts as it is a way of life, this ingenious pasta gives the Italian pastaios a run for their money. Owing its name to the particular shape of an elephants trunk (surla), each piese soaks up the sause a blissful tinypackage filled with flavour. Once exclusive to the homesteads of Istra and Kvarner, you need not go for a home visit to taste some of the dishes made with Šurlice. Menus of restaurants and konobe (taverns) in Baška feature those delicacies regularly and they are definitely a mouthwatering treat. Usually served with a lamb stew, locally as žvacet, or some of many interesting sause prepared by Baška chefs, they are a divine pairing of local ingredients and a taste of the local life."
8,Baška,Asparagus,"Have you ever tasted a Krk asparagus? No, we are not talking about the domesticated, thick stalked variety you can find in local supermarket. We are talking about the thin and delicate queen of nature's bounty, growing wild and free in the countrside. Wild asparagus, handpicked and served in homea and restaurants across the northern Adriatic is a treat you simply must taste at least once in your life. The dark green delicacy is made even more special by ita short harvesting season (it growa in the spring and picking is restricted) and its scarceness. Taste  it in traditional fritaja (omelette) or as part of the meat, seafood, and pasta dishes. The interesting, slightly bitter taste, quite unlike the common asparagus, gives each dish  a very special, luxurious finish. Vrbnička Žlahtina The name of the grape and consequwntly of the wine comes from the local word žlahten meaning noble. This proves the importance of winemaking to the island of Krk. Grape growing and viticulture are tied with thie region since the antiquity. Owing to the idel climate conditions, coastal Croatia is home to many serious wines. While Dalmatia is known for the red grape varietals like Plavac Mali, on Krk, in the area around the village of Vrbnik and near Baška (St Lucy Žlahtina), delicious white dry wine Žlahtina reigns supreme. Characterized by the discreeet aroma rounded by flowery notes of wild sorb, immortelle and apple and low in alcohol, tannins and acid, Žlahtina is a summer wine next to none. Light and refreshing it is able to lift the spirit and bring a smile to the face in a single sip. Try it paired with a tradinional meat dish or with a summery mozzarella and fig salad, just like the locals do."
8,Baška,Krk Lamb,"The legend has it that Roman emperor Nero enjoyed Krk lamb, served at the feasts in Rome. If he had it on a more regular basis, maybe he wouldn't eventually have the great city burned. We will never know. Sheep graze freely here and their diet consists of salt infused aromatic herbs that grow in the wild, making the meat supremely delicious. This salty, aromatic herb fed lamb is an ingredient of many traditional dishes and more modern interpretations served on Krk. Widely recognized as one of the finest in all the land, in stiff competition with Pag and Cres island, it might just be the ultimate delicacy of Croatia. There are many ways pf preparing lamb, all of them traditional and deliciuos. Try it prepared charcoal grilled with aromatic herbs, or ispod peke (under the bell), or simply do what the locals do and order a lamb žvacet (stew), served with valcići pasta. krk lamb  is so  well known and so  loved by all who have had the opportunity to taste it that Baška featires an annual festival dedicated to this delicacy. Thys unmissable event is called Crna ovca (The Black Sheep). During the festival you will get the chance to decide for yourself which Krk chef makes the very best lamb dishes, enjoy sports events, concerts and art exhibitions."
8,Baška,Sage honey,"Apiaries on Prvić island are home to busy bees working hard to turn the fragrant sage into the sweetest, richest honey in Croatia. Seize the opportunity to grab a jar (or a dozen) made by local family farms as a delicious souvenir that will remind you of all the good times and fine bites you had while visiting Baška."
8,Baška,Olive oil,"Krk locals have an unusually long lifespan. The legend of a land generously gifted by nuture, with mild climate and light Mediterranean cuisine is made a reality by each one hundred year old local on the island. The secret of their longevity is hidden in the ""youth, health and beauty elixir) which is bountiful here. This is the famous Krk olive oil - a key addition to local and national dishes."
8,Baška,Sheep cheese,"This medium-fat content hard cheese is a true delicacy. Sheep of Krk remain outdoors throughout the whole year and graze on wild aromatic herbs likesage and imortelle, which imbues rhe milk and dairy products with a delicious natural aroma. Cheesemaking on Krk embodies traditional methods and offers a vivid image of what the island tastes like - karst landscape, bora bitten pastures, fragrant herbs and sea salt. Krk Pršut (cured ham) Renowned for its taste, cured ham from Krk is significant for being the first Croatian product with a protected geographical indication by the EU. This extraordinary delicacy is salted by the wild Krk herbs, uncured and dried in the bura wind. Enjoy its unique taste, preferrably with some sheep cheese and glass of Žlahtina in one of the local taverns"

It is a small chapel, modest in appearance and at first glance not much different than typical village churches dotting the Adriatic islands and seaside settlements. But this particular chapel hides a rare and very interesting find beneath its foundations. Twin basilicas that once stood there are a 1500-year-old marvel of sacral architecture. Christian symbolism is most clearly visible in the cross-shaped floorplan of the larger, northern basilica, as well as in the cross-shaped baptistery and baptismal font, making it quite unique for the early Christian period. The mosaic tiled floor has been only partially uncovered, but even such it shows the exquisite craftsmanship and grandeur of a monument equal to the greatest Christian churches. 4 Islands MTB race Advent in Baška Baška International Guitar Festival Baška Outdoor Festival Baška rožica"

In its relaxed and intimate edition, you will find the Biograd Street Music Festival. And maybe, more than anything else, you are in love with sailing? Biograd with its two marina represents an important nautical center, and the Biograd Boat Show provides high quality proof to that reputation. Biograd na Moru is a royal, Croatian town which was first mentioned in the middle of the 10th century, and in the 11th century, it became the seat for Croatian kings and bishops. Biograd experienced its most glorious days as the capital under Croatian rulers during the Middle Ages, and in 1102, the Austro-Hungarian King Koloman was crowned right here in Biograd! Numerous material evidences confirm the ever-turbulent and rich history of the Biograd area, which have been archived in the exceptionally interesting Historical Museum, with easy access due to its location on the seaside walkway. Biograd is small city, but with an absolutely rich history from which Christian sacral buildings are mirrored, such as the parish basilica of Saint Anastasia (1761.), as well as the early Romanesque-styled church of St. Ante (13th century), and the church of St. Rocco (16th century). As far as ancient Biograd architecture is concerned, only the basilica of St. Ivan (11th century) managed to survive the Venetian destruction of Biograd in the year 1125, but on the nearby island of Pašman, the 800-year-old Benedictine seminary of Saints Kuzma and Damian (erected in 1128) is still standing, gloriously intact, as well as the Franciscan seminary of Saint Dujam from the 16th century."

15,Biograd na Moru,Health tourism,"Health tourism is one of the oldest specific forms of tourism in which natural healing agents and methods of physical therapy are used in a professional and controlled manner in order to preserve and promote health and improve the quality of life. The basis of health tourism is the use of natural healing factors that can be marine, thermal and climatic. The Special Hospital for Orthopedics is a modern center for the treatment of orthopedic diseases. The current name Special Hospital for Orthopedics was created in 1994. Under this name, the hospital operates through three departments: Orthopedic, Extended Treatment and Physiotherapy."
15,Biograd na Moru,Manifestations,"Our most numerous guests inspired us for this event, which over the years has expanded from a weekend to an entire week, and has become the most active event on the Adriatic. Every year, during Labor Day, Biograd is flooded by Slovenian neighbors overwhelming the city with their spirit. It is a very active, playful and entertaining spirit that carries away everyone else with it! During the Slovenian Weekend, you can do jogging, sail, walk or just dance in the evening! The most visited in recent years was the Biograd Run Race at 1.5 or 10 km, along the route by the sea over the waterfront, beach, park and Soline Forest Park. Older guests prefer Biograd Walk, recreational 4.5 km long walk. Slovenians cannot imagine themselves without a bicycle, so it is of no wonder that they adore the family bicycle race. As part of the event, an attractive Biograd regatta is held every year. During Gastro Biograd, the entire waterfront becomes one huge table, the Biograd Table! The menu includes only autochthonous Croatian products and dishes, from Slavonian, Istrian, Lika to Dalmatian specialties. Various master chefs and local caterers compete on who is the better chef and visitors taste the dishes! In 2019, the main attraction was seafood risotto for 500 people! There was also the largest frittata on the Adriatic, but also continental risotto with mushrooms prepared by our friends from Bjelovar. They are seasoned with wines from Croatian vineyards and the feast continues until early morning hours."

They offer the riches of the crystalline sea, seven kilometres of natural pebble beaches, the scent and the beauty of the thick pine tree forest (in large part a natural monument), numerous pedestrian zones which entangle from the walking area along the coast, to the old hamlets, proud of the old Dalmatian architecture, and all the way to the peaks of the mountain Biokovo. Brela municipality consists of two locations (localities, parts): Brela Gornja (Upper Brela), situated in the hinterland of Biokovo, and the settlement Brela, consisting of a few small hamlets on the both sides of the main road. The biggest of them are Soline and Donje Selo."
20,Brela,Active holidays,"Even though people feel well also during walks through a park or a forest, a stay by the sea awakens positive feelings which are soothing, and the person feels as if he or she had recharged his or her batteries. The sea air contains negative ions and ozone which encourage deep breathing and fill us with life energy. The promenade along the sea as far as Brela extends from Jakiruša to Berulija is 7 km long and, if you feel ready, you can extend it to other towns of the Makarska Riviera. Regardless whether you walk or ride a bike, a normal physical effort suffices for you health, which is 150 minutes of exercise a week. This is enough for the heart to start working faster. Recommendation: When you go for a walk, wear comfortable clothing and shoes. Breathe in with full lungs and start! On the first day walk for 30 minutes. For the first 5 minutes warm up walking lightly, and in the past 5 minutes slow down. Fast walking on the first day of exercise should take 10 minutes maximum. Make short steps, bend your arms in the elbows under a 90° angle and keep them at the level of your waist with your shoulders relaxed. Start the walk 3 times a week and then every day. Walk whenever you can. With time slowly increase the duration of your walk until your reach 60 minutes. You may do the promenade also by Nordic walking. This is an activity that engages almost all large muscles in the body, and it also ensures favourable conditions for the circulatory system operation. Besides, Nordic walking is intended for all ages, so that the activity can be practiced by children, adults and the elderly. We recommend organised walks 3 times a week with the supervision and a programme of a professional guide! Bikini Dive Centre is a small family company offering many adventures above and below the sea.

20,Brela,Beaches,"One of the most beautiful gravel beaches of the world is in a protected area, a cape covered in pine forest. In July 2004, the American Forbes magazine listed this beach among the 10 most beautiful beaches in the world. Among the most famous ones, such as Copacabana, St. Tropez, Costa del Sol, and the exotic beaches in Belize, Antigua and the Maldives, there is also a small part of the Croatian beauty and for a good reason. In 2014 The Huffington Post  website described Brela as dream destination and a perfect reason to get on a plane to Croatia as soon as possible. According to Belgian website European Best Destinations - Punta Rata is one of the most beautiful beaches in 2015. The beach is a winner of numerous prizes in Croatia as well. On the Western side of the beach there is the Brela Stone - a symbol of Brela, the most common motive from postcards of Brela and Croatia. The rock is covered in pines proudly protruding and presenting all its beauty and force, power and spite to grow from stone. Brela have successfully combined the natural beauty and the human care for nature conservation. The success was achieved, apart from the stunning nature, also through vision, capability and skills of the local people. The Podrače beach in Brela is one of the most photographed beaches of Croatia. It is in very close proximity to Punta Rata beach. The European Parliament published a video on their Twitter profile providing suggestions on where to go swimming this summer. The first place was taken by our magnificent pebble bay - the Podrače beach in Brela. In 2015 beach Podrače was listed among the 15 most beautiful and desirable vacation destinations by the site European Best Destinations. The peak of the picturesque stone embracing this turquoise blue bay in the past was used by local inhabitants for the production of sea salt by evaporation of sea in shallow pools."
20,Brela,Culture,"The road represents an exceptional architectural contribution in road construction from the beginning of the 19th century (built during the period 1810-1811). It was never completed so it is possible to reconstruct all phases of its construction. It was built, or rather laid, on a slope of Biokovo, between 357.41 and 443.73 meters above sea level. The rise does not exceed 6%, in order to make the road very comfortable for driving carts, horse-riding and walking. The architect Frane Zavoreo is the project engineer of the French road on Biokovo. Interpretation boards are positioned along the road, in order to bring you closer and to provide you an understanding and to explain you the manner and purpose of building this truly exceptional and valuable road. In addition, the entire road is a wonderful viewpoint on Brela, the Riviera of Makarska and the islands! The French road is listed in the Register of Cultural Goods of Croatia on 25th September 2017. (WARNING: Easy, but mountain trail!) A complex of Filipović houses, which, besides the function of living had also a defensive function against the Turks. When the danger ceased, both towers were adapted to apartment houses."
20,Brela,Nature,"Together with Berulia beach, the Medvidina Cave was once the habitat of the Mediterranean Monk Seal after which it received its name. The Mediterranean monk seal is species of seal and one of the most endangered mammals. In this region they are also known as morski medvid (sea bear) or morski čovik (sea man). Fishermen considered them to be enemies as they often destroyed theirnets. It disappeared from the Adriatic Coast in the 1960s, however, we have been able to see it lately, especially along the Istrian coast. ""Sea, sea..."" they say that the Croatians exclaimed this on the Dupci pass when they arrived at the Adriatic. Here the rocks swoop more than 100 m deep. The Vruja cove is a gigantic system of wells with an underwater spring of 60 m in diameter standing out, from which a huge amount of water is springing. It is located immediately below the Dupci pass (288 m) separating the Biokovo mountain (1762 m) from the Dovanj mass (864 m), a part of the Omiš Dinara. There are large springs at Drvenik, Drašnice and Gradac, but none is equal to this one. By the water springing from it, it is probably the largest in the Adriatic. Below the steep rocks there are beautiful and sheltered gravel beaches which are best accessed by sea, by ship from Brela or Pisak, due to extraordinarily steep and inaccessible terrain surrounding them. Large schools of fish gathering in order to feed and reproduce make a beautiful view.a"
20,Brela,Sacral facilities,"The parish church of St. Stephen Protomartyr was built in historicism shapes in 1887-1897 and it is positioned at the location of the more modest predecessor from the beginning of the 18th century. Today's belfry, completed in 1966, changed the neo-romanticism church façade with a bell gable. The church is mentioned as far back as 1626, in the Ottoman period, which proves the existence of the former, medieval building. With its position it is connected with the lower positioned graveyard with gravestones from the 15th century, decorated with symbols of shields and swords, today converted into an archaeological park. Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr, is the patron saint of the municipality Brela. The feast day of Saint Stephen and Brela municipality day is celebrated on 3rd August. Situated in Soline, a valuable monument of the baroque architecture in harmony with the surroundings. Since it was built in 1715 in the appreciation of the victory against the Turks, it is also known as the Church of Lady of Victory. The bishop of Makarska Nikola Bijanković (1645-1730) - an enthusiast when it comes to Brela obliged Brela and the inhabitants of Brela in many things. After the victory over the Ottomans near Sinj in 1715, he built the church of Our Lady of Victory (today the church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel) in Brela. On the 300th anniversary of the construction of the church, on 16.07.2015, the grateful inhabitants of Brela raised him a monument located in the churchyard. The feast day of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16th July."
21,Brinje,Brinje,"At the very heart of the Croatian mountain region lies Brinje, the crown jewel of Lika and its northern-most point.

22,Brtonigla - Verteneglio,Brtonigla - Verteneglio,"Istria is a true open-air museum, a treasury of little, exceptional gems. The parish church in Brtonigla was named after St. Zeno, an early Christian bishop from Verona, who is also a patron saint of this Istrian town. It is generally considered that St. Zeno was a native of North Africa. During his 10-year service as a bishop, he carried out several reforms of church customs. The inside of St. Zeno's church in Brtonigla is light and clear. The ceiling is flat, the apse is polygonal and the side walls are decorated with marble altars, made in neo-baroque style. A small vestibule is located between the entrance portal and the main church area. There are two larger windows at the front, while the decoration beneath the roof cornice was built as an array of hanging arches. The high, peaked belfry rises from the middle of the front, and on each side of the belfry, there are two small spires which imitate it. St Zeno was built between 1859 and 1861 at the location of the similar older church which some sources date back to 1480. Although there were some indications back in the 16th century that the old church might have been expanded, that did not happen until the second half of the 19th century, when the building received its present shape. In the second half of 20th century, a statue of St. Zeno reading the missal was added above the front portal. The statue is a masterpiece of the academic sculptor Aleksandar Rukavina, a great aficionado of this area. When passing through Brtonigla don't miss the opportunity to visit Mramornica cave, considered by many speleologists to be one of Istria's largest and loveliest subterranean structures. Mramornica Cave was first mentioned in the writings of travel writer Albert Fortis in 1770. Today, it is open to both the young and the old seeking for adventure. From the very entrance of the cave, a steep stairway leads down to a large chamber filled with dripstone formations of different colours and huge stalagmites some 13 metres tall and up to 10 metres wide. The trails leading through the cave are well-maintained and equipped with safety railings from which you can peer into the cave's mysterious but inaccessible parts that reach down to inconceivable depths. To find your way to Mramornica Cave, just follow the signs leading to the Sterle agritourism farm where the cave is located. Nature lovers will enjoy the refreshing chill of the cave's underground chambers, and the whole family can take pleasure in the various activities offered at the Sterle farm. To residents of the area, Nature Park Škarline is an inseparable part of local identity and holds an indelible place in the collective mind. Visitors to the area sometimes fail to discover this perfectly preserved nature park located only two kilometres from Brtonigla and named Škarline after the stream that springs in the park. Along its course to Mirna River, several kilometres to the south, the stream has created a luscious, green canyon, one of its kind in Istria. A two-kilometre macadam track leads from the village of Nova Vas, near Brtonigla, along the edges of vineyards to the nature park. In dry weather, the nature park can be reached by car. To find out how to reach the park directly from Brtonigla, contact the local tourist office. The canyon is not immediately visible from the park entrance. First, you will encounter a tame, spacious landscape with meadows, two small lakes and a bridge. Several benches and a tap for potable water make this picture-perfect area a great spot for a picnic, and fun and games. Sveti Juraj fortress, also known as Santi Quaranta, is a protected cultural monument in the municipality of Brtonigla, located above the Mirna river valley near Nova Vas. The fortress is divided into a northern and southern part by an interior wall. Today, its trapezoidal floor plan and well-maintained walls are still visible. The northern plateau was once the centre of a Mediaeval town, and today it features an archaeological site with the ruins of the Church of St George."
22,Brtonigla - Verteneglio,The strategic location of the fortress,"Sveti Juraj fortress was built on a strategic position above the mouth of the river Mirna and its harbour. There may have been a prehistoric fortification and ancient settlement in the same place, followed by an ancient and early-Mediaeval fortified military camp. According to some sources, goods were delivered to Pišine harbour on the river Mirna until 1906, after which the pier was blocked with silt. A fire was lit on one of the fortress towers to help keep sailors on a safe course towards the harbour. The fortress' owners Historical sources note that the fortress belonged to Alderus de Castro S. Giorgii in 992AD, and it is known that it also belonged to Vidotto and Flabiano in 1230. The patriarch of Aquileia purchased three-fourths of the property from America qm. Vidotti and the remaining fourth from Biachini, son of the late Ossalco di Momiano. He then renovated and expanded the fortress to create a new stronghold from which to guard his estate in Istria. After the Venetians attacked in 1291 and the Genoese in 1354, the fortress lost its important political and military role, and began to pass from owner to owner. After 1420, the Venetian Republic gave it to Grožnjan. In 1545, Alessandro Soranza bought the fortress and its fief for 1,627 ducats, with the requirement that he pay a portion of his profits to maintain the churches of St George and St Michael. The last owners were B In the complete shade of the hinterland of Brtonigla, in the idyllic green scenery, one can find the gallery of the academic sculptor and painter Aleksandar Rukavina (1934. - 1985.). It is nicely nested and adapted to the mild descent, following the natural configuration of the soil. The Memorial Gallery shows the overview of works of this Zagreb-born artist, who had a special connection to the Istrian area and people. An exhibition is staged every year, on the 16th of September, to commemorate his death. The Gallery was founded a couple of years after his death and its permanent collection shows the intersection of his abundant work as a sculptor. The verdant park surrounding the gallery emanates a special atmosphere of its own that daily enchants the inhabitants of this picturesque small town - for you it can be an excellent venue for a family picnic in the fresh breeze."
22,Brtonigla - Verteneglio,The gallery layout,"The gallery's layout is centred on 37 sculptures preserved in the atelier. The gallery collection has been broadened with the work of the artist's colleagues: a bronze bust of Aleksandar Rukavina created in 1989 by academy educated sculptor Tonči Orlić exhibited at the entrance, and a portrait of the sculptor's mother painted by academy educated painter Alma Orlić in 1987. The concept of the gallery's spatial organisation and layout is based on sculptures presented as characteristic of the chronological and formative phases in the artist's work. The gallery is conceived as a circular exhibition space encompassing four interconnected spaces and a small depository. Although the gallery serves primarily as a memorial centre it also, from time to time, hosts exhibitions featuring other artists and musical and literary presentations, both inside the gallery and outdoors. *Guests can visit the gallery by making reservations in advance with the Tourism Board office. Separate visiting times can be arranged for organised group visits. Entrance is free of charge."
22,Brtonigla - Verteneglio,About sculptor Aleksandar Rukavina,"Rukavina cooperated with the master workshop of Vanja Radauš, one of the greatest Croatian 20th c. sculptors. He belonged to the younger generation of rebellious artists who announced the new trends in the then Yugoslav arts by their joint exhibition in the Zagreb Modern Gallery in 1960. He worked with various materials and motifs, and the centre of his interests was mostly the human figure. He used the contrast of the processed and raw surface of the material, mostly rock and wood. Rukavina left Zagreb in early 1960s and moved to Istria. In 1960s he lived in Buje and taught arts in local schools, until he moved to Brtonigla in 1971. Throughout this time, he also worked as a sculptor and initiated many cultural projects. The Church of St. Roch, the patron saint of Brtonigla, was built on the location of the former 14th century Church of St. John the Baptist. This church was ""moved"" after the old Church of St. Roch, which was located elsewhere, became unusable after a plague outbreak in 1855, and was relocated to the Church of St. John the Baptist. Today, the Church of St. Roch features a wooden altar with statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Roch, St. Sebastian, St. Peter, St. Paul and St. John the Baptist, to whom the church was once dedicated. The church is rectangular with a semi-circular apse. Saint Roch, protector against plague and cholera According to some written sources, St. Roch was born in 1295 in the French town of Montpellier with a mole in the shape of a cross on his chest. He belonged to a noble family, however he lost both his parents at a young age. After the death of his parents, he sold all his belongings and distributed them to the poor, and then went to Rome as a pilgrim. On his numerous journeys and pilgrimages, he did good deeds and helped victims of the plague, of which he also eventually died. St. Roch is venerated in many churches and cities in Croatia today, and believers call upon him most often when they need protection from infectious diseases. The tradition of celebrating St. Roch in Brtonigla on 16 August gave birth to one of the most popular folk celebrations in Istria - the Feast Day of St. Roch. This three-day event includes diverse sports, entertainment, music and gourmet programmes, and draws numerous visitors from Croatia and abroad. On the Feast Day of St. Roch, a traditional holy mass is held, and there is a procession from the Church of St. Roch to the parish church in Brtonigla. Istria sits on four different types of soil, which are named after their colours - black, white, red and grey. Aside from colour, these soils differ in numerous other characteristics that make them suitable to raise various agricultural products - especially wine grapes. One of the four jewels of northwestern Istria - Brtonigla - is unique in the entire Istrian peninsula (and perhaps even further afield) in that its terroir of a mere 32.72km2 contains all four types of soil."
22,Brtonigla - Verteneglio,A wine project to remember,"This little hilltop town has recognised the exceptional potential of the four soils surrounding it, and has undertaken a truly special, praiseworthy project. In 2010, in local vineyards featuring nearly identical microclimatic conditions, the local Istrian Malvasia variety was planted - of course, in each of the four different types of soil. In the years that followed, with painstaking, diligent monitoring by experts from multiple scientific fields, the project enjoyed spectacular success! Malvasia grapes raised in the same way, subjected to the same vinification process, even harvested on the same day, resulted in wines of equally high quality but completely different flavour characteristics! These four wines from the four soils of Brtonigla received their own labels, and they can be found often on the wine lists of well-known northwestern Istrian restaurants, who pair them with various gourmet delights. After Malvasia - Teran! The perspective of the project ""Four Soils - Four Wines of Brtonigla"" hasn't stopped with just one variety of grape. The identical process has also been undertaken for another local Istrian variety - Teran. But the hard-working residents of Brtonigla then asked themselves, and with good reason - why stop with wine?! These were the foundations for the idea of producing olive oils on the four Istrian soils. If you are interested in sampling the fruits of this interesting project, you can do so with local producers, who will gladly tell you the story of the four soils and the four wines of Brtonigla - alongside a glass or two of wine, of course. Folk festivities are an opportunity to discover Brtonigla and its inhabitants in a truly unique way. Some of the most fascinating events are the Choco & Wine Fest (February), the Istrian Malvasia Festival (June), Colours of Tradition (July), St Roch Feast Day (August), Mushroom Days (October) and many others. More The town, just like many other places in Istria, is very rich in culture and history that many visitors come to experience, including the traditional Feast of Saint Rocco. Every August, locals and foreigners gather to celebrate the guardian of Brtonigla - St. Rocco. While the chapel dedicated to the saint can be visited all year round in the medieval heart of town, the Feast of Saint Rocco is an event that packs endless amounts fun into a several day period. This summer festival is filled with activities for visitors of all interests and ages. For those seeking to please their tastebuds, a genuine Istrian gastro experience can be found at one of the many taverns, serving dishes prepared with fresh local produce and ingredients. Sport enthusiasts can hop on a bike and race in the San Rocco Bike Tournament, or compete for the gold in a futsal game dubbed St. Rocco's Cup. These are only a few of the exciting activities offered."
23,Buje,Buje,"Situated on a hill 222 meters above sea level, the town of Buje dominates the surrounding green terraced fields."
23,Buje,A view from the belfry,"Should you find yourself in Buje, walk along the old, stone-paved streets to the town's ancient centre on the hill. On the main square, next to the resplendent Church of St. Servulus, stands a belfry dating back to the 15th century. In fair weather, the view from the belfry encompasses parts of four countries: Slovenia, Italy, Austria and Croatia. In 2011. the belfry has been completely renovated to allow visits for a greater number of tourists. The wooden stairs leading to the top have been reconstructed. A safety railing and transparent, Plexiglas sheets protect the observatory encircling the bells, providing an unobstructed view in all four directions. A wire mesh protects the bells, which are also an attraction. The belfry is one of the highest in Istria, next only to the 63-metre belfry in Vodnjan, some 70 kilometres to the south. Buje - ""the Guard of Istria"" and a city with two bell towers What makes Buje even more interesting is the fact that its old town has two belfries. The second belfry, slightly lower but nonetheless imposing, is located next to the Mother of Mercy Church. The bell tower was given the nickname ""the guard of Istria"" because it was the watchtower for the entire region, and the 13th-century city seal bore the image of the bell tower, the guard of the city."
23,Buje,Buje and surrounding settlements,"The Buje-Buie Region stretches from the river Mirna to the river Dragonja, which also marks the border line with the Republic of Slovenia. This is an area with wavelike hills covered with vineyards, olive groves and fields sprinkled with oak, cerris and pine woods and Mediterranean meadows with wild thyme and fir trees and a karst belt full of interesting geological phenomena. Today, the entire region of Buje-Buie is the most famous winegrowing part of Istria with numerous wine cellars and farmhouses (agritourism). There are lovely medieval towns in the vicinity; the most famous ones are Grožnjan-Grisignana, Momjan and Završje. Five kilometres from Buje-Buie towards Pula-Pola lies the settlement Krasica with nearby hamlets like Gardoši, Baredine, Lozari, Punta and others. The scattered hills used to be seats of prehistoric fortresses. The findings from the Roman Age reveal huge fortresses like Gradina, located at the important road - Via Flavia. Inscriptions, artefacts and coins, votive figurine of the Goddess Fortune, fragments of carved marble and columns are kept in museums in Trieste, Pula-Pola und Poreč or have been built into the side wall of the church in Buje-Buie. Right after the turn to Baredine rises a hill, hiding amidst its lush plants the remains of the legendary Castrum Lionis, which was donated in 1102 to the church in Aquilea by the Count of Istria Ulrich II, the son of the Istrian Margrave Ulrich I of Weimar.a"
23,Buje,Cultural and sacred heritage,"One thing is for sure - in Buje, you simply must visit the magnificent St. Servulus church, named after the patron of the city and situated only several metres away from the belfry-belvedere, in the very centre of the old town at the hill. St Servulus is the main church in Buje and one of the most important late baroque monuments in Istria. With its monumental dimensions, it is used only in the most formal occasions, for mass festivities on St Servulus day or for the organ festival, a prestigious cultural event. The church in its present form was erected in the second half of the 18th century, at the previous location of the old roman-gothic three-nave 13th century church. The elements of the older building were inbuilt into the new edifice, and they are visible at the front even today. It is believed that an antic temple was located there a long time ago. The Church of Our Lady of Mercy, built in 1587, is located on Trg Slobode Square, which also features a 17th century bell tower and the city ethnographic museum. The year 1587 was carved at the outside jamb of the left side door to the church, as a memorial to the completion of works. In front of the church, there is a picturesque »fresco« from 1590 and a belfry with a clock and a 22 high passageway. With apparently simple but harmonious architecture, it contains invaluable artworks in its interior. Art historians claim that the sculpture of Our Lady of Mercy is one of the most beautiful wooden sculptures in Istria. It is the work of the Venetian workshops of Paolo Campsa and Giovanni de Malines. The statue is placed between statues of St. Joseph and St. Servulus, and is closed behind a gold-plated metal grating of exceptional value."
23,Buje,Gastronomy,"From town to town, from village to village, from cellar to cellar this road impeccably traces the golden wine. In the Buje-Buie region wine has brought to friendly terms the ever-lasting rivalry between the ancient experience of ancestors and the modern achievements of their descendants. Istrian malvazija, muskat, white and grey pinot, chardonnay, hrvatica, refosk, teran, borgonja, merlot, cabernet sauvignon are characteristic sorts of wines. The amazing golden-green, yellow, pink, ruby-red are mysterious rainbow colours of intoxication. There is something called the Momjanski muskat that people indulge in as in life itself. And for the end, cream on the top - hrvatica, an autochtonous sort, a subtle exciting rose."
23,Buje,The refreshing taste of Istria,"In 2013, the brewery of San Servolo was born just a few kilometers away from the town of Buje in northwestern Istria, claiming its name after the patron of the town. Brewing its beer according to the German Beer Purity Act of 1516, San Servolo uses only four ingredients to craft the perfect glass: barley malt, hops, yeast and natural spring water from the source of Saint Ivan (located in the Mirna River Valley). You can sample their six varieties and visit the San Servolo Brewery to try beer-inspired cuisines such as beer soup or even, beeramisu!"
23,Buje,Buje in Roman times,"With the coming of Roman rule to Istria, the territory of Buje became the landed property of the Trieste colony and a part of the Venetia et Histria region. The prehistoric hill-fort was abandoned at that time but resettled in late Antiquity by refugees fleeing barbarian invasions. Buje gradually acquired the features of a fortified medieval town. The period up to the 13th century After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the reign of the Ostrogoths, the town peacefully became part of the Byzantine Empire. Slavic colonisation soon began, and by the late 8th century, Buje was absorbed by the Carolingian Empire. In documents, the town is first mentioned as Castrum Bugle in 981 in a charter of the German-Roman emperor, Otto II. At the time, the Kaštel (Castle) of Buje was under the Patriarchate of Aquileia, an ecclesiastical and administrative unit of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 13th century, the town was given a higher level of autonomy and became a Free Commune. In the early 15th century it was occupied by the Venetian Republic following the signing of a surrender treaty in 1412. In retaliation for the town's resistance to the Republic and loyalty to the Patriarchate of Aquileia, the Venetians tore down its defence walls, fortification and belfry. The fortification was rebuilt several decades later."
23,Buje,Sport activities,"Due to its special geomorphologic location the Buje-Buie Region is an ideal area for different sports activities, either spontaneously in the natural surroundings being for the most part almost intact, or by joining the existing local sports structures. The period from autumn to late spring is particularly well-suited for biking on roads less travelled. Mountain bike fans have at their disposal a number of marked mountain bike trails described and depicted in detail on a separately issued mountain bike map. Bike riding across hills and valleys is one of best ways of exploring these gorgeous landscapes and panoramas stretching towards the sea. In the area of Momjan which is situated in the upper part of the Buje-Buie Region the horse riding fans, accompanied by experienced guides, can experience the pleasure of riding along the well-trodden riding paths."
23,Buje,The Guard City,"In the past, Buje was known as the ""guard of Istria"" because of its strategic position 222 metres above sea level. Its mediaeval ramparts, the Tower of St. Martin and two bell towers rise proudly above its hilly surroundings: The bell tower of the 15th-century Church of St. Servulus - The bell tower was also a watchtower that ensured the safety of the entire area and was featured on the city's seal in the 13th century The bell tower of the 17th-century Church of Our Lady of Mercy - The bell tower is 22 m high, featuring a clock and a unique passageway across from which is located the ethnographic museum"
24,Buzet,Buzet,"The capital city of the divine truffle, with breath-taking views of the valleys carved by river Mirna is an unusual amalgamation of all the best Istria can offer.

27,Čavle,VIRTUAL WALK,"The Čebuhar's House is also known as the Čavle stone monument of Louisiana Road. Today's historical and tourist landmark was once a popular meeting point and refreshment place for many travellers and waggoners. The house is also a monument to the reputable and enterprising Čebuhar family, whose lineage was broken in 1963. It is located in the very centre of Čavle, so do not forget to visit it. The old town of Grobnik today represents the most important cultural point of the wider area of Grobnišćina (Grobnik region), and the tourist potential guaranteed by its good location and rich heritage makes it an unmissable destination for all visitors to this picturesque area. We also invite you to take a stroll through the old town of Grobnik, through the time and legacy of the people who have lived here. The widely known Grobnik bell-ringers have an interesting story to tell about every item that they use, from their costumes and equipment to the way they move. Although they are part of folklore today, they have long played a key role in the survival and protection of villages from enemies, whether in the form of barbarians or wild beasts. Take a peek into their marvellous world full of symbolism and tradition, and if you like it, become a bell-ringer! Grobnik has long been recognised as a destination for lovers of good local food. First and foremost are the unmissable polenta withpotato and Grobnik cheese, as well as the products of Grobnik's skilled butchers. Potato polenta (""palenta kompirica"") fed generations and generations of the people of Grobnik, but they did not remain indebted to it.Today, the big Festival of Polenta and Cheese is organised in honour of polenta, family gatherings do not pass without it, and the dish has grown into a famous delicacy that every visitor to the Grobnik region wants to try. Few dishes have so many fans, so if you haven't already, try this repeatedly sung about dish at the first opportunity. Bon appetit! The favourite delicacy of the people of this area is Grobnik cheese, in whose honour the Festival of Polenta and Cheese is organised every year. Cheese has a very long tradition and specific way of being made. You can find out more by visiting one of the local Grobnik cheesemakers and check out how this traditional Grobnik dish fits into the 21st century. The Grobnik area (Grobnišćina) provides ideal living conditions for both humans and plants as well as animals. So, it is not surprising that the people of this area successfully achieve coexistence with nature, and visitors come to explore the richness of flora and fauna, and often return home with a sprig of lavender for their wardrobe, sage for tea or some bay leaves for the perfect lunch. In addition to various species of domestic grazing animals, nature lovers can find the habitats for various birds in Grobnik's forests. One is a raven that makes its nests on rocks, trees, or even uses the abandoned nests of other birds. You will also often find black woodpecker, the largest woodpecker in the region, and the slightly smaller nesting bird thesong thrush. Whilst staying in nature, you will also encounter a variety of butterflies, and one of the frequent inhabitants of these areas is the painted lady, mostly orange in colour, and it can spotted from April to October. Plants that you can see along the roads will give you special pleasure when walking or cycling, and one of the perennials is the golden lily that which grows in the nutritious soils in the deciduous forests or in the mountain and hilly meadows that the area abounds in. When hiking between June and September, we might also come across the protected edelweiss. In the rocky areas of the lowlands, you will be captivated by the scents of various grasses and native Mediterranean herbs such as sage, immortelle, heather, rosemary, lavender and laurel. Native people have learned the value of these herbs and use them daily in food preparation, cosmetics and the household, from some of them come highly prized types of honey."

29,Central Istria,Destinations,"A city with a long and rich tradition - Pazin - is located in the very heart of the Istrian peninsula, only thirty kilometers away from the famous tourist centers. Pazin is mentioned for the first time in the year 983 in a document by which Emperor Otto confirms the donation of the fortress Castrum Pisinum to the bishops of Poreč. Life is in this town on equal intensity in winter and summer and every first Tuesday of the month a veritable river of curious people from all over Istria flows here, visiting the traditional Pazin Fair. Pazin is the place that is adorned with the largest and best-preserved medieval fortress in Istria - the Pazin castle - which is located on the cliff above the Pazin cave, a unique work of natural forces through the canyon of which the river Pazinčica flows. The fact that the Pazin cave leaves no one indifferent is evidenced by the fact that, just like the Pazin Castle, we find it in the works of numerous travel writers and it was an inspiration for many famous writers, such as Dante, Jules Verne and Vladimir Nazor. Cerovlje is the central place of a large municipality spreading over the undulating landscape northeast of Pazin and comprising numerous hamlets and villages: Borut, Draguć, Grimalda, Gologorica, Paz and Pazinski Novaki. Such natural features brought to it plentiful particularities throughout history and continuing until the present time. Inaccessibility and isolation were the reasons for the very poor or non-existent influence of Rome to this remote piece of its province. Pathless ravines in the east, fortified by carefully arranged forts (Gradina, Paz, Šabec, later Belaj, Posrt) in the Middle Ages created an unassailable frontier used by the Istrian Margrave to expand his dominion which was further defended by the forts of Boljun, Lupoglav, Roč, Črni grad and Beli grad in the north and Letaj, Barban, Rakalj and Sutivanac in the south. The slow arrival of modern changes to the secluded villages, which were only recently upgraded with good roads, led to the depopulation and complete abandonment of some villages. On the other hand, it also influenced the preservation of many ethnologic particularities and the way of living, which have already been made history in other parts of Istria. If you are searching for the true rural Istria, you are in the right place."

29,Central Istria,Natural attractions,"Vela or Vranjska draga is the monument of exceptional geomorphologic value. It was created by water torrents which made a 3500 meter long canyon in limestone rocks. It starts at the Zrinščak tunnel and ends at the Boljunsko polje. It is special for its pointy rocks, with 50-90 meter tall towers, some of which were destroyed during the construction of the Učka tunnel. The highest part of the canyon is at 600 meters above the sea level, while the lowest is the one at the Boljunsko polje at the level of only 153 meters. The canyon is covered by lush vegetation ranging from willows and poplars to beech and jew. Some of it is the rainforest. Vela draga has been protected as a nature reserve since 1963 and after, 1998, as a geomorphologic monument of nature. Apart from teaching about geological phenomena, this trail also teaches about alpine and free climbing, sports which have existed in Vela draga since 1931, when alpine climber Emilio Comici climbed his first alpine route. Vela draga has thus in time become a known climbing spot for acquiring precious experience by many Croatian and European alpine climbers. The symbol of Karojba are the four impressive pine trees right in the centre of the town. Those trees were declared a botanical monument of nature in the year of 1966. The distinctiveness of these trees is that they grow deep in the continent, away from the sea. The pines (Pinus pinea) have the so-called umbrella treetops. The girth of the biggest tree is 3,3 metres and the height 14,5 metres. The tree is more than 160 years old."
29,Central Istria,Sacred heritage,"Paulines monastery originally was Benedictine, but in 1459. was given to the Paulines - the white monks - who restored the monastery. Interestingly enough, they arranged the cloister in the way that they put the new Renaissance columns on the ground floor and moved the old Romanesque ones to the floor above. The monastery church of St. Peter and Paul the Apostle were then restored in Gothic style. It was re-dedicated in 1755 with baroque facade and in the same style, which we encounter very rarely in Istria, richly equipped interior of the church. The cemetery church of Saint Mary of the Rocks, situated 1 km to the north-east from Beram, within itself holds one of the most valuable acomplishments of Istrian medieval painting. Well preserved late-gothic frescos almost entirely cover the inner walls of the church, and they were made by master Vincent of Kastav. The paintings were commissioned by Beram confraternitiy of St. Mary, so most of their space is dedicated to scenes from lives of Mary and Jesus. The strongest impression leaves the fresco called Dance of the Dead, where in front of our eyes kings, merchants, cardinals, even the Pope himself dance hand in hand with death. In the XVIII. century, during the baroque period, the church was expanded and renovated, which caused most of the frescos to be damaged or destroyed. All the frescos were painted over and hidden at that time, and rediscovered and renovated in the year 1913."

33,Cres,Center Beli,"Visitor Center and Griffon Vulture Recovery Center Beli The island of Cres is one of the few remaining habitats of the griffon vulture, a rare and endangered scavenger bird. The population of griffon vultures on Cres is the only one in the world that nests on cliffs directly above the sea. The ""Visitor Center and Griffon Vulture Recovery Center Beli"" in the town of Beli on the northern part of the island of Cres is dedicated to the protection of griffon vultures. Professional staff and interactive exhibits contribute significantly to creating a brighter future for griffon vultures. The Center also includes a recovery center for rescued birds. Most of the rescued birds are released back into the wild after rehabilitation. Thanks to the Center, griffon vultures are a common sight on the island of Cres: if you look up to the sky, you may spot these enormous birds with their wings outstretched, soaring on air currents in search of food. In captivity, griffon vultures can live up to 40 years, but their lifespan in the wild is somewhat shorter. Their wingspan can reach up to 280 centimeters, and adult birds can weigh up to 12 kilograms. Griffon Vultures are Adventurous Spirits: Young birds embark on a multi-year journey during which they roam Europe, Africa, and the Middle East until they reach sexual maturity at the age of five. Griffon vultures from Cres have been spotted in areas from Africa to Sweden. After their grand journey, they return home to find a mate and build a nest. Griffon vultures mate for life. One pair produces one egg annually, usually in the middle of winter. The chick hatches after 110-120 days, and in spring, it learns to fly. This is the most delicate period for their survival: since this population nests directly above the sea, chicks often fall into the sea while attempting to learn to fly. To prevent the birds from drowning as they are unable to extricate themselves from the sea, the staff at the Center (see above) play an invaluable role: during this period, they watch over the nests in shifts and swiftly rescue the chicks that fall into the sea, which would almost certainly perish without their intervention. Griffon vultures are truly nature's cleaners and are closely connected with free-range sheep farming on the island: sheep live and die in the wild, and griffon vultures feed on their carcasses, thereby keeping the environment clean and preventing the development of diseases that decomposition processes would favor. Problems for griffon vultures began with the decline in sheep on the island. However, this is not the only reason for their decline and endangerment. You can learn much more about these fantastic birds by visiting the ""Visitor Center and Griffon Vulture Recovery Center Beli,"" which we highly recommend. Cres Hike & Bike Unspoilt nature and good weather throughout the year provide numerous opportunities for outdoor activities on the island of Cres. For nature lovers and those who want to get to know the island, there are about 300 km of marked hiking trails that link the rugged interior of the island with the glittering beauty of its coast.

33,Cres,Cultural and Artistic Events,"Numerous cultural and artistic events held mostly in the summer offer a variety of cultural and entertainment program such as: environment events, film and music festivals, festivities, gourmet events, car shows, theater plays, visual arts events and colonies, literary evenings, fairs, church fairs and sports events. Cres & Lošinj Trail Weekend trail is a race composed of two separate stages with three difficulty categories: Purple, Blue, and Green. Competitors choose the category in which they want to compete and, accordingly, select one or both days of this unique event."
33,Cres,Cultural Heritage,"The landscape of Cres is a perfect setting for cultural heritage - city walls, old stone gate, numerous paintings, distyles and trefoils. In the very centre most of the houses are one-storey or two-storied buildings while in the harbour public buildings were built such as the Duke's Palace, Loggia, arsenal, numerous patrician palaces and the so called fondaco where corn was kept. The Franciscan monastery complex is located just off the historical centre. As usual with monasteries, its original location was outside the city walls, but as the city grew the monastery complex became part of the city centre. The complex comprises several buildings: Saint Francis of Assisi's church with an adjacent bell tower, two cloisters, dormitories, a refectory, and gardens with an olive grove. In the past, the monastic territory went all the way down to the sea shore."
33,Cres,Gastro,"Gourmet dishes on the island are unquestionably worth pointing out. Imagination has always been a must for preparing food: having only a few ingredients, it takes a lot of love and effort to make a tasty dish. Dishes prepared according to the old traditional recipes, seasoned with local aromatic herbs and olive oil are a typical trait of Cres cuisine. The most admired delicacy of Cres is certainly lamb: its taste is extraordinary thanks to the traditional free sheep grazing - the pasture is rich in both salt and vegetation. Homemade sheep cheese with prosciutto and olives make a delicious starter to any meal. Seafood lovers can go for fresh fish, shrimps, lobsters and other crabs and clams prepared in many different ways and seasoned with homemade olive oil. One should definitely end the meal with a glass of homemade brandy with aromatic herbs. In addition to original dishes from the island, many restaurants and trattorias also offer international cuisine. Visit restaurants on the island of Cres and enjoy local delicacies."
33,Cres,Nature,"Thanks to its very mild and favorable climate and microclimate, clean air, and sea, as well as abundant wild and medicinal herbs, the island of Cres can be considered a natural spa. This was confirmed by the pioneers of essential oil production from sage, helichrysum, and bay laurel - father and son Andrija Linardić - who already in 1903 established an essential oil factory in the small village of Martinšćica on the island of Cres. In 1908, they were the first in the world to distill essential oil from helichrysum, and they conducted business with the largest pharmaceutical companies of that era in Europe and America. On the island of Cres, more than 1,400 different plant species grow. Sage, helichrysum, dandelion, nettle, and other wild and medicinal herbs make the island of Cres a true botanical garden. Olive is also indispensable, and from its autochthonous varieties, šimjaca and plavac, high-quality olive oil is obtained, characterized by all the scents and flavors of the island. Extra virgin olive oil Cres is the first olive oil in the Republic of Croatia protected by the mark of origin. In addition to the plant diversity, the untouched nature of the island of Cres and favorable weather conditions throughout the year create opportunities for the development of outdoor activities (hiking, mountaineering, cycling). Cres is the largest Adriatic island, with several climate and vegetation zones, and a freshwater lake of drinking water, located in the heart of the island (Vransko Lake). Besides Krk and Lošinj, Cres is now considered one of the richest islands in terms of flora, many of which consist of relict and endemic plants. The richness of flora is complemented by the richness of fauna. The abundant plant and animal life poses a real challenge for nature enthusiasts. Cres is one of the last habitats of a very rare bird - the griffon vulture. It's also interesting to note that there are no venomous snakes on Cres. In addition to the griffon vulture, sheep are another symbol of Cres, with around 10,000 of them freely grazing on the island's vast pastures. For centuries, the Cres sheep has been the main source of food on the island, nourishing and clothing generations of islanders. In the past, the main product of Cres sheep was wool, but today it's the well-known young Cres lamb."
33,Cres,Route Cres,"The Group for a Better Life on the island of Cres, founded in 2000 with a mission to preserve the island's original values and improve its social, cultural, ecological, and tourist identity. Over the past two decades, ""Route"" has become known primarily for promoting sheep's wool, which is no longer used on the island as it once was but is left in nature. They have offered at least a partial solution to this problem - processing wool using the felting method into various useful items, thus turning them into authentic island souvenirs. Although the ecological problem of wool on the island of Cres, and in Croatia as a whole, has not yet been solved, ""Route"" has successfully utilized the discarded wool wealth and popularized working with wool. They are recognized through numerous creative felting workshops, appearances at fairs, and exhibitions. They serve as a successful example of long-standing hard work, new ideas, and project development. Today, ""Route's"" work is based on promoting artistic expression, creative work with children and young people, promoting wool and island tradition, and enriching the tourist offer of the island of Cres through creative workshops for both local and foreign guests. The direction of ""Route's"" development is further development and implementation of projects related to wool felting and organizing and participating in exhibitions."
33,Cres,Sheep Farming Museum Lubenice,"The former Lubenice parish manor houses the Sheep Farming Museum, a volunteer project of the local association ""Rural Island Group."" The Sheep Farming Museum is a non-profit, non-governmental, and non-partisan organization founded with the aim of preserving the cultural, historical material, and intangible heritage of the island of Cres. In addition to the permanent exhibition that presents the practices and customs related to sheep farming, a series of projects are carried out to promote the preservation of indigenous folk architecture, revitalization of the local economy, the use of renewable energy sources, environmental protection, landscape interpretation, and the development of projects related to sustainable island tourism. The exhibition is designed as a unique journey through the year: as visitors walk through the exhibition, they simultaneously traverse the seasonal activities that do not align with calendar years but are synchronized with the biological and climatological features of the micro-location. Each room is dedicated to tasks that occur in a specific season. Visitors can also watch a three-part documentary film that documents the processes of tanning sheepskins, sheep shearing, and cheese making. In a separate room, there is a photographic exhibition by Dražen Lapić titled ""Judi z Garbina,"" which pays tribute to the residents of Garbin, the western part of the island of Cres, who have preserved the tradition of sheep farming to this day. The renovated complex of the former parish manor, where the Sheep Farming Museum is located, represents a unique example of rural-urban architecture. Various events and pleasant gatherings with visitors are held in the courtyard and garden. On the ground floor, there is a souvenir shop with publications and souvenirs from the association, as well as unique woolen products from other organizations and individuals from the Republic of Croatia."
33,Cres,The island of Cres,"The island of Cres is a perfect natural health resort thanks to its mild climate, beautiful beaches, crystal-clear sea, and untouched nature. More than 1,400 different plant species grow here, such as sage, immortelle, spurge, dandelion, nettle and other wild and medicinal herbs, which make Cres a true botanical garden. The island is also home to the Cres sheep, which is the most common animal (there being several thousand of them on the island), and also to the griffon vulture, a protected bird species and one of the largest flying birds in the world. Unspoilt nature and good weather throughout the year provide numerous opportunities for outdoor activities. The island of Cres offers attractive hiking and biking trails that combine the wilderness of the hinterland with the shimmering beauty of the coast. A tour of the island will take you to interesting historical and cultural sites such as the town of Cres, built in the Venetian style, the ancient settlements of Lubenice and Beli, or the old fishing villages of Valun and Martinšćica. Traditional island cuisine is a real treat for food lovers. It is based on local ingredients such as fish, extra virgin olive oil, honey, cheese, and Cres lamb, which is a well-known island delicacy. If diversity is another name for wealth, then the island of Cres is a real pearl and a unique holiday destination, for it is one of the last places where you can experience the Mediterranean as it once was. The town of Cres is the largest settlement on the island. Located in a sheltered bay, in the past it was a convenient harbour for ships in bad weather. This geographical location led to the development of fishing, seafaring and shipbuilding, and the shape of the bay and its sheltered position contributed to the construction of the marina in the southeastern part of the town. It is surrounded by numerous olive groves, from which the famous Cres olive oil is produced. The town of Cres is rich in cultural and historical monuments, most of which date from the Renaissance period. The presence of numerous palaces of wealthy Renaissance families, larger and smaller churches, town gates, monasteries, a tower and the town loggia give Cres a special cultural and historical significance. The town is characterised by a network of charming streets opening into small squares, and a walking tour will reveal its many interesting sights: Remains of the town walls (town gate), Arsan Palace - Municipal Museum, Town Loggia, Clock Tower, Town Tower, Parish Church of St Mary the Great, Church of St Isidore, Monastery of St Francis, Moise Palace, Town Hall."
33,Cres,Tramuntana Forest,"Tramuntana is the name for the northern part of the island of Cres. Cres is an elongated island, with the northern part having a subcontinental climate, while the climate in the southern part is already Mediterranean. As a result, the northern part is significantly different from the rest of the island: it is covered with dense forests of oak and chestnut trees, teeming with mushrooms and rocks covered in moss, and inhabited by forest animals such as hares, deer, wild boars, mouflon, and even moles (which are not found on other Adriatic islands). Snow is a common occurrence in winter, and in the summer, the forest is pleasant and cool compared to other parts of the island. In the past, Tramuntana was a populated area, but its villages have been gradually abandoned over the past century. The reasons are typical: challenging living conditions, world wars, and emigration to more developed areas. Visitors are often moved by the sight of the remnants of villages that still stand alongside once-cultivated land. Not far from one of these villages - the village of Petrići - is the deepest cave on the island: Banićeva Cave, with a depth of 100 meters. Four complete skeletons of the cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) were found there, and it is of great interest to biospeleologists as three species of cave insects found there now bear the name ""Cres"" in their Latin names. Among the attractions of Tramuntana, it's worth mentioning the sheep troughs used for watering the sheep, beautiful pastures, and labyrinths created in wide meadows with the aim of deepening the connection between Man and the Spirit of Nature. Five labyrinths of Tramuntana are modeled after well-known labyrinths from around the world and are dedicated to ancient nature and fertility deities: Vesna, Ishtar, Lada, Tara, and Rusalkas. The hiking trails in Tramuntana mostly follow the routes of old roads that once connected the villages and now connect these points of interest while passing through the beautiful nature full of wild orchids, butterflies, and aromatic herbs. In the spring, when sage is in bloom, the hills are covered with its intoxicating purple flowers, attracting bees that produce excellent local sage honey."

In 1776, a great fire devastated Kotor, and most of the population moved towards the sea. Fisherman's hut The Fisherman's Hut was created from the desire to honor the former fishermen of Jadranovo and its surroundings. Fish, and fishermen, are becoming increasingly rare.

The Church was converted into the Ibrahim Pasha Mosque - one of the three mosques in the area which is today Đakovo. Other sources claim that the Mosque was built on the grounds of the aforementioned church.

Everyone can find something to enjoy. If you like tradition and folklore, children events, gastronomic events, sports events, etc. visit Đakovo and choose from the variety of events you want to enjoy and participate in. Known and unknown about Đakovo In 1962, 74 Lipizzans from Djakovo participated in the filming of Walt Disney's """"Miracle of the White Stallions"""". Walt Disney, himself a great connoisseur of the animal world, was very pleased, so when he finished filming he said, """"If it weren't for these wonderful horses, I couldn't have realized the idea. I was impressed by the beauty, obedience and fearlessness of the Lipizzaners."""" Đakovo was among the first town's in Croatia to have a tambura ensemble Tambura is a plucked string instrument. There are different types of the instrument according to its size, form and number of strings. Tambura is not an autochthon, but a traditional instrument in Slavonia and Baranja (as well as Croatia). According to Buddhist mythology, the first tambura was made by Tamburu, the patron deity of music and musicians. In1842 in Đakovo the ensemble Illyrian Tabura Players had been established as a part of the Assembly of Spiritual Youth is not as widely known. Today, Đakovo is known as a city with many tambura bands."
35,Đakovo,Touch a meteorite,"An unusual stone, suspected to be a meteoroid by the local people, is located in a prominent spot in the Strossmayer park. Unfortunately, it is just a chert specimen of terrestrial origin, probably leftover construction material of the Cathedral, but interesting enough to inspire the imagination of the local people and their guests. Trace of Mozart in Đakovo After being appointed the bishop in Đakovo in 1806, Antun Mandić established a choir and small orchestra in the Cathedral, and the leader of that orchestra was the famous Viennese musician and composer Jakob Haibel, Mozart's brother-in-law. He stayed in Đakovo until his death, and at that time he composed 16 masses. It is little known that in 1806, Haibel got a small clavichord delivered to Đakovo, which was previously owned by Mozart. Haibel played this instrument and composed on it until his death on 24 March 1826. His widow Sofija put his private possessions up for sale and subsequently returned to Austria. The Three Gates of the Pavić Street The most famous legend from Đakovo was depicted in the ballad The Three Gates of the Pavić Street (Pavićanske tri kapije) which describes the town's Romeo and Juliet. These three gates lead to three houses that still exist, and were inhabited by employees of the diocese: winegrowers, with a relief of grape wines on the facade; woodsmen, symbolized by the oak leaves relief on the facade, and the third hose was inhabited by musicians, symbolized by the lyre relief on the facade. In one of the gates some hundred years ago a tragedy happened - a young man, probably head over heels in love, pulled a knife and ended his life during a romantic argument. To commemorate that tragic event, a sad ballad was made ""Pavićanske tri kapije"". Eugen Nirjak and Mirko Kladarić recorded the earliest verses of that ballad, and the band Slavonske lole together with the singer Vera Svoboda recorded the song at the beginning of the 1990s and brought it back from oblivion. Đakovo, the home of the world''s greatest handball player Domagoj Duvnjak (born in Đakovo, 1 June 1988) is a Croatian professional handball player for the Croatian national team and for THW Kiel at the moment. His playing position is centre back. Domagoj has shown extraordinary talent from early childhood. When he was 14, Irfan Smajlagić invited him to play on the Cadet National Team. He won the European Champion title as a cadet in Estonia and was declared Championship Player. Playing for the Handball Club Đakovo (2004-2006), he made his debut in the 1st Croatian Handball League when he was 16. Two years later, he made the League's top scorer. His skill and results resulted in his transfer to the Handball Club Zagreb in 2006. He played for Zagreb for two years in European cups as a starter. From 2009 to 2014, Domagoj played for Handball Sport Verein Hamburg (Germany). He has been playing for German THW Kiel since 2014. He made his debut in a big senior cup at the World Championship 2007 in Germany, where Croatia was the fifth. Selector Lino Červar included him in the list for the European Championship in Norway in 2008, where he won his first big medal as a senior (silver). Handball-Planet declared Domagoj the World's Best Handball Player 2013. As the Captain of the Croatian National Team, Domagoj Duvnjak was declared the Most Valuable Player at the European Handball Championship 2020. Born in Đakovo, Domagoj promotes Đakovo, Slavonija and Croatia in the country and abroad with his sports successes, and promotes handball, of which we are very proud. Spend the weekend in the heart of Slavonia - Đakovo Đakovo offers an abundance of historical, cultural and natural sites, which can be seen in a day, but to really experience them, one needs to stay longer. Numerous religious buildings and cultural-historic monuments are located in the historical centre of Đakovo, which make the town recognizable and unique. The main street, Ulica pape Ivana Pavla II (Pope John Paul II Street), commonly known as Korzo, stretches from the St. Peter's Cathedral to the Church of All Saints. The town's core has kept its Art Noveau features which developed in the 18th and 19th century. This gives Đakovo its allure and shapes the visitors' experience, especially during nice weather when the main street becomes a promenade and a place for socializing, and the numerous cafes and patisseries located there invite to a break. Top 5 places you shouldn''t miss 1. St. Peters Cathedral 2. State Stud farm Đakovo 3. Wine cellar of Đakovo - Osijek Archdiocese 4. Museum of Đakovština and Memorial Museum of Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer 5. Church of All Saints Walk through the bishop''s city Museum of Đakovština and Memorial Museum of Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer The Museum of Đakovština was established in 1952, when the permanent exhibition was set up. The Museum's valuable collections include: the archaeological collection, the historic-cultural collection, the ethnographic collection, the numismatic collection, and the paintings gallery. The interior of the Museum's building is divided into studios, the permanent collection room, and a multi-purpose exhibition hall, which is currently the venue of the Museum's activities (exhibitions, workshops, book presentations, concerts, seminars, etc.). The back building, which has been in function since 2016, houses the library and depots and is the venue of different workshops. St. Peters Cathedral ""The church in Đakovo becomes its geographical location and it will remind our people of the divine purpose, which we, as the population of this part of Europe, are especially prompted to fulfil. This needs to be the quest of all our art..."" Josip Juraj Strossmayer wrote in 1874, eight years after the beginning and eight years before the completion of the construction of the most important cultural monument in Đakovo, the most beautiful cathedral between Venice and Istanbul, as the famous the Good Pope John XXIII described it. State Stud farm Đakovo One of the most important and most durable symbols of Đakovo and the Đakovština area are horses, which have been bred for more than five centuries on the famous Stud Farm in Đakovo - now the State Stud Farm. Wine cellar of Đakovo - Osijek Archdiocese The beginnings of the winemaking and viticulture tradition of the Diocese Đakovo-Osijek can be traced back to the Pre-Ottoman period. After the liberation from the Turks, Bishop Petar Bakić restored the winemaking tradition by planting vineyards in Trnava, and Bishop Josip Čolnić expanded them. Bishop Antun Mandić established the vineyards in Mandićevac, on the slopes of Krndija, and Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer built the wine cellars in Trnava and Mandićevac. Centuries passed, lords came and went, but the famous, acclaimed, and premium quality wines of the Đakovo wine region have outlasted these events."

It is located on the mild hills of Papuk, in the greenery of preserved nature and is one of the most beautiful cities in continental Croatia, which preserves a story longer than 2000 years. According to archeological finds, the life of people in the Daruvar area can be traced back to the Late Stone Age, but we get more complete picture of this area from the Roman period. At the time of the Roman Empire in this area there was a settlement of the native people of Jasa who lived next to the thermal springs of healing water. The name Jasa means """"the people of the spa or healers"""". The Romans built a settlement called Aquae Balissae on this site. Exactly around these springs of healing water, which you can also enjoy, Daruvar has developed as an oasis of peace and relaxation. Wines have been grown here for centuries and they are among the best in continental Croatia, and the wineries provide eno-gastronomic pleasure worthy of the Romans themselves or the famous Daruvar nobility. In this city, toasts are also made with top-quality beer, and the recipe and tradition of cooking and brewing beer were brought to this area by immigrant Czechs. Stomach problems, however, are treated with homemade plum brandy. Precisely on the tradition of wine, beer and brandy, some of the most famous events in Daruvar and nearby Sirač were created, which offer to every visitor a real rhapsody of flavors and aromas. Toasting with premium drinks and hanging out with loved ones are just some of the reasons to visit them. The name of the town hides the Hungarian name Crane town or Crane castle, as the noble count Antun Janković of Daruvar called it when he bought the property. This city will win you over with the greenery and beauty of its parks, the promenade along the river Toplica, the landscaped central square, the beautiful castle of the Janković family and its ever-living multiculturalism.

36,Daruvar-Papuk,Sights,"Daruvar in Hungarian means Cranes town (daru=crane, var=town)! Antun Jankovich, in 1745, bought the northern part of the estate Sirač that included Podborje. Queen Maria Theresa, on the 28th of February 1765, granted Count Jankovich the title ""de Daruvar"" because of the crane in his family's coat of arms. Since then, the name Podborje started to vanish and it was totally lost when Antun Jankovich built the castle (1771-1777) and called it Daruvar (in Hungarian Daruvar means Crane's town or Crane's castle).The Crane's pose, turned to the right side with its leg raised, presents constant alert on the watch. Antun Jankovich was the founder of today's town and because of that, the symbol on the town's coat of arms is a crane. Among other things, in the Spa park there are two outfitted thermal water springs: Antun's well and Ivan's well, which is also called the Wishing well. Daruvar is distinguishable by its warm water springs with healing properties, or, in other words, by its thermal wells, and by its deposits of mineral treasures such as peloid and ""fango"". Thermo-mineral water was always used for healing and rehabilitation and also, because of its healing properties, for baths and drinking. Thermal water is, according to its composition and balneological classification, acratothermal (indifferent water with mineralization under 1g/liter). Chemical analysis determined that calcium and magnesium prevail among the kations, and hidrocarbonates prevail among the anions. As far as radioactivity goes, it is very low and decreases with a water source. The chemical composition of all of the water springs in town is almost identical, but the temperature varies from 39,2 to 47,5 degrees Celsius."

The old library includes over 10,000 volumes with valuable incunabula and manuscripts by Dubrovnik writers. Behind the Cathedral, and across from Bunić Square one reaches Gundulic Square with the statue of Ivan Gundilić, one of Dubrovnik's finest 18th century poets. The Statue is the work of Ivan Rendić from 1892, and its pedestal is adorned with the bronze relieves depicting the scenes from Gundulić's epic Osman. The fort rises high on a 37-metre high sea cliff outside the city walls. One can approach it from the little Pile beach climbing the flight of stairs in the shadow of pine trees. The people of Dubrovnik built the fort in order to protect the western sea access to the City, particularly from the Venetian fleet. The construction began in 1018 and was completed in the 16th century. The thickness of the walls facing the sea is between 4 and 12 metres. Above the entrance is an inscription in Latin: NON BENE PRO TOTO LIBERTAS VENDITUR AURO (Freedom is not sold for all the gold of the world). Entering the City from the east, through the Ploče Gate, along the street between the southern side of the Dominican Monastery and the city wall, through the Custom's Gate, you will come to Stradun, the centre of all events in the Old City. Above the Gate is the 15th century Luža, restored in 1952. Next to it raises the City Bell Tower with a clock built in 1444. The founder Ivan Rabljanin cast its large bell in 1506. The two famous figures called Zelenci, who strike the hours with their hammers, were cast in bronze at the same period. The tower was damaged in the earthquake of 1667. In order to prevent the collapse, the old Bell Tower was rebuilt in 1929 and the original figures of Zelenci were replaced by their copies. The originals are now exhibited in the Rector`s Palace. Walking eastward along the landward side of the walls up to Ploče Gate, where Revelin Fort, standing outside the city wall, completes the defence complex, one reaches the tower of St. Luke. In 1467 Paskoje Miličević designed a bulwark for the old St. Luke's Tower with openings for cannons. The tower once controlled the access to the harbour. One of the oldest parts of the City was built around the Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today, on the site of the pre-Romanesque Cathedral and the later Rectors Palace, encircling the City Harbour. Walking towards the eastern entrance to the City one faces the Lazaretto Complex at Ploče. The eastern suburb Ploče used to be the meeting place of merchants caravans and travellers from the Ottoman Empire. The first quarantine was thus built at Ploče as early as 1377 for the purpose of isolating the travellers and goods from eastern countries, where the outbreaks of contagious diseases were frequent. One of the most significant monuments of profane architecture on the Croatian coast, the Rectors Palace, was the administrative centre of the Dubrovnik Republic Its style is basically Gothic, with Renaissance and Baroque reconstructions. In the 15th century the Palace was destroyed twice in gunpowder explosions. Restored by Onofrio della Cava in the late Gothic style after the first explosion in 1435, the palace got its present-day size with the central atrium and front portico. Make sure to begin your brief visit to Dubrovnik with a stroll along Stradun or Placa the main street, while getting the first impressions of one of the Mediterranean's most beautiful cities.

The 1940-metre long walls encompass five forts and sixteen towers and bastions. The world's second most attractive museum in the open air, the walls are open for visitors all year round. The three entrances to the walls include those next to St Luke's Church in the east, next to St Saviour's Church at the Pile entrance to the Old City and next to the Maritime Museum located at St John's Fort. Taking a walk along the Dubrovnik city walls you will see some of the striking fortresses used for the defence of the Dubrovnik Republic. Of the five existing forts, Minčeta, Bokar and St John were built within the city walls complex, whereas the two freestanding ones include Lovrjenac in the west and Revelin in the east. Located at the highest point of the city Fort Minčeta protected Dubrovnik from the north. The fort is the symbol of Dubrovnik's defence and the flag of our homeland waves on it all the time. In summer you can also see the Libertas flag flying on Fort Minčeta. In the southwest Fort Bokar, also called Zvjezdan, stands at the corner of the city walls facing Lovrjenac."
45,Dugi Rat,Dugi Rat,The municipality of Dugi Rat stretches along the coastal part of the historical Republic of Poljice.
45,Dugi Rat,Cultural heritage,"The invading Turks fortunately spared Lower Poljica from total destruction, but after 1699 and 1715 AD they moved further inland and conditions then favoured the renovation and resettlement of the villages. The population increased and economy strengthened. The villages of Lower Poljica were built where the flysch slopes meet the upper mountain cliffs. Here the inhabitants were able to grow crops and to keep cattle. There was virtually no connection with the sea until the end of the 19th century. The land was not much worked in Jesenice and Duće since most of it belonged to noble families in the neighbouring towns of Split and Omiš and to the Archbishopric of Split. The villages were therefore forced to make very economical use of the space and to preserve carefully the fertile soil. The settlements were crowded and the houses lay in close rows below the mountain in larger or smaller groups and with various orientations, but mostly in an east-west direction, so that the front facades faced south. The pitched roofs were covered with stone slabs, sometimes white-washed and with occasional luminaries. Over the course of time the hoses were improved in certain ways. The oldest houses were close by the mountainside and used the terrain as part of their structure. The rear side was therefore truncated, being next to the slope of the mountain, which served as a passage into the upper floor of the house. In some earlier examples, the houses were placed at right-angles to the contour of the mountain, with their gables facing south. They were constructed from irregular, roughly worked stones of variable size. The lower sections of the walls were thicker and were made of larger boulders. The occasional doors and windows were irregular and bore no relation to one another. The frames were made from large pieces of stone an on the ground floor the lintels were often massive. Some had gently rounded wooden lintels. One house in Jesenice has the year 1740 carved into lintel. Houses began to take a different form towards the end of the 18th century. The larger buildings were built facing southwards, the stone-work became more refined and construction was more regular. Windows and doors were given proper frames and were placed more harmoniously, and the houses were more spacious. Entrance to the upper storey was by an outside staircase. When a house had two storeys, the upper floor was reached by an internal wooden staircase. The houses all had a similar layout inside: the ground floor was used for utilitarian purposes (as storage space and, rarely, to keep cattle). The upper floor served as living space, while the kitchen consisted of a separate ground-floor room, either connected to, or leaning against the main part of the house. Around the house there would be other buildings fulfilling the functions of daily life, often forming a courtyard. Groups of individual families lived together harmoniously. Their houses were connected by narrow winding streets, stairways and passages, many of which were paved with pebbles or stone slabs of various sizes. There are such groupings of houses in each village, for example the houses of the Lozić family in Krug and of the Vojnović family in Duće, both built during the 18th and 19th century. As the families prospered and expanded, so also their groups of houses were enlarged. During this period the environment was gradually tamed: the flysch slopes ‘comprising a compacted sand-bearing shale) were restrained with stone walls and the ditches and water-courses were controlled. Grazing areas were defined within long stone walls, and wider tracks were constructed, joining villages near and far. We have no definite information indicating when the churches in Jesenice, Krug, Zeljovići and Duće were originally built. They are all mentioned in documents describing visits to the area by Archbishop Stjepan Cupilli in 1711, but it is not clear whether the churches were 16th and 17th century improvements of chapels dating from the Middle Ages, or whether they were constructed in their present forms after Poljica ceased to recognise government by the Turks. The churches of St. Stephen (St. Stjepan or Sustipan), St. Andrew on Oblik and St. Maximus on the hill above Krug were certainly built during the Middle Ages. The church of St. Andrew id mentioned in the Statute of Poljica of 1676 AD as marking the frequently disputed boundary between the villages of Jesenice and Tugare."

45,Dugi Rat,History,"In 1991 archaeologist Romeo Jerčić and the author of this article found a stone inscription bearing the name Nertastina in the wine-cellar of one Mrs. Julija Klarić, widow of the poet Branko Klarić. Until this discovery, the only physical evidence of the existence of the Nerastina tribe, other than in ancient sources, had been two outer boundary stones found long ago. The stone slab with the inscription measures 43x33x17 cm and has an edge raised by 4 cm and lettering 2.6 cm high. It most probably comes from Sustipan. The inscription therefore refers to the temple dedicated to Diana and Asclepius which the Nerastina people renovated completely. One further fragment of the inscription, measuring 22x18x11 cm and mentioning the Nerastina, was found in the autumn of 1991 by Romeo Jerčić in a stony border around his land on Sustipan. These inscription are very similar, having almost the same size of letters and both referring to the renewal of some public building. The Sumpetar collection of deeds (the ""kartular"") of the Benedictine monastery of St. Peter in Selo (Sumpetar) provides the most comprehensive information about Poljica in the Middle Ager. These invaluable documents, now kept in the archive of the Metropolitan Chapter House in Split, contain valuable data about the life of the nobleman Petar Crni Gumajev of Split, who built a Benedictine monastery on his land in 1080 at his own expense, alongside the earlier church of St. Peter. In his later years, Petar Crni retired into this monastery, founded by him and his wife Ana. He adopted the Benedictine habit and eventually died there. He was buried in an early-Christian sarcophagus bearing an inscription which can now be seen in the Museum of Archaeological Remains in Split. It is presumed that the first four lines of the inscription were written by Petar himself and that it was completed by Dobre after Petar's death. The Sumpetar collection of deeds. the ""kartular"", is essentially a description of the geographical state of the pious endowment which had its largest estates in the coastal area of Poljica. it is therefore a first-class document showing the toponymy and economic relationships of the area in the Middle Ages. The monastery of St. Peter in the village ceased to exist after the Mongols penetrated into Croatia, and by the 14th century the properties and the deserted monastery devolved to the Archbishop of Split. The ruined church was subsequently repaired and the front side of Petar's sarcophagus came to serve a new function: it became the altar ""menza"" in the new church. This is known only from extant archaeological documentation."

Visit the underworld the Baredine Cave. This cave is a treasure chest of stalagmites and stalactites, underworld sculptures created through time by the patient work of water. Such shapes have been created, some of which are exceptional, such as the 10 meter long and high curtains, a very realistic sculpture of Our Lady, the body of a milkmaid called Milka, the leaning tower of Pizza and snowman the torchbearer-who has become the trade mark of our cave. In one of the atriums you will pass a crater that is 4m wide and 66 m deep which goes down to the underground lakes. And so through five halls, five galleries of abstract and realistic sculptures, a pleasant 40 minute walk, accompanied by our guide and custodian. The excitement of this adventure is also meeting the animals of the underworld. You will see the human fish and endemic animals that live only in this environment, miniature see-through crabs and insects. At the cave's entrance there is a museum showcase where pottery of prehistoric man has been exhibited. Our far ancestors would probably leave the pots during the hot, dry, summer day to collect the precious water, drop by drop. Funtana's Sights This church is a one- nave building with the sacristy, built in 1621, extended in the 1941 and reconstructed in 1988.

51,Funtana,History of Funtana,"Back in the ancient times the place was called Fontana Georgiana, as proven by the documents related to the bishop Pacea de Vedano from Trieste (1331) who leased Funtana to the aristocrat Andrea Dandolo Veneto. The village is also mentioned as Val de Fontane - Fauntain Valley, Fontane di Pace - the Fauntain of Peace, and Portus Fontane - Fauntain Port. Between the border of the Vrsar Duchy, Val Fornazina and Val Sepera towards Poreč used to be located the Funtana Duchy - Contea di Fontane, since 1781 the county of Funtana, Distretto di Fontane. At the end of the 17th century P. Petroni had been staying in Funtana and in those days its castle was obviously the most important place of the village. According to his writings, it was built 4 miles from Poreč and a mile from Vrsar. Petroni left a nice present to the inhabitants of Funtana, a drawing of the village from the 1681. During summer droughts, both people from distant villages and the lodgers of the castle used to use the water from two fresh water springs next to the sea. They used to transport the water in barrels. During the high seas and when schirocco blew, the springs were flooded by sea water, but not long after the withdrawal of the sea the fresh water had the same excellent quality. Lots of the paths and side roads from the neighbourhood led to these springs. This part of Istria abounds with fresh water, the source of life. Nowadays, when a visitor comes to Funtana, he'll notice a slogan: ""Funtana, at the sources of friendship"" - this saying reminds of the grapes of nature and of the warm hospitality of your hosts."

If you want to make lasting memories with your family or friends, this outing spot is a unique opportunity to do so on an exceptional one-day trip. There once was a time when the natural landscapes of Gorski Kotar were inaccessible, wild and untamed. On old maps, the area was commonly referred to as ""Hortus diabolicus"", or the ""Devil's Garden"". This inaccessibility has created a safe and hidden haven for many plant and animal species. Gorski Kotar is a treasure trove of diverse landscapes, luscious and preserved forest vegetation, clear rivers, streams and lakes, pristine nature, as well as spread out, but harmonious, diverse habitats. In order to experience the forest in all of its glory, you need to wander through one of its sanctuaries, such as Risnjak National Park, or get lost in the corners of the wooded and rocky labyrinths of the untouched nature, such as the White and Samarske Rocks strict nature reserve, where the trees fall down from old age or dry up like scarecrows swaying in the wind, rotting on the forest bed for decades, and providing a safe haven to tens and thousands of species of mushrooms, moss, slime mould, algae, micro-organisms, as well as numerous small and large animals, until they break down into the soil, creating fertile humus and providing nutrients for new trees to grow. The unique mosaic of forest communities and the playful karst terrain can also be witnessed at Golubinjak Forest Park, packing a wealth of natural beauty and unique features of the area, despite its relatively small size. Endowed with a great habitat diversity, Gorski Kotar takes us on an exciting and unusual journey through deciduous forests, pure coniferous forests, a mix of both, as well as other types of forest communities. Stepping from a deciduous forest to a pure coniferous forest is common for the ""frost pockets"" scattered across Gorski Kotar. The low areas of land are prone to lower temperatures compared to the surrounding areas, as well as frost, naturally attracting plant species that thrive in those colder conditions, such as plants native to mountain tops. It seems as though our short ""journey"" through the rich nature of Gorski Kotar has transported us all the way to the far north of Europe, to one of the Scandinavian countries, into the realm of the boreal taiga forest! The most important inhabitants of the forests of Gorski Kotar are beech, fir and spruce trees. The richness of flora in this woodland is reflected by the large number of endemic and relict species, such as Hacquetia epipactis, Omphalodes and Lamium. The luscious forests of Gorski Kotar are also home to an abundance of wildlife. The region is part of the Natura 2000 ecological network, composed of areas important for the preservation of wildlife habitats and habitat types, as well as numerous bird species, such as the golden eagle, rock pigeons, Ural owl, western capercaillie, common buzzard, black woodpecker, woodpecker, and boreal owl. Ornithological research conducted in Gorski Kotar recorded 97 bird species, of which 72 nest in and around Risnjak National Park. Visitors are sure to spot, or at least hear, some of them while visiting the Park. Gorski Kotar is also home to many other animal species. It is one of the rare places in Europe still inhabited by the three representatives of Europe's large carnivores: the brown bear, the grey wolf and the Eurasian lynx. In these parts, large carnivores have lived alongside humans since ancient times, sharing the same living space and food resources, which has led to conflicts in the past. A coexistence marked by prejudice, hate and negative symbolism has resulted in complete extinction of these animals in most European countries. The mere fact that Gorski Kotar is still home to these majestic animals is a testimony to the degree of preservation of the landscapes and habitats they live in. Today, we know a great deal more about these large carnivores, especially their role as apex predators in the ecosystem, as well as their role in shaping the natural landscape of Gorski Kotar. If you're lucky, while visiting Risnjak National Park or another part of the wilderness of Gorski Kotar, you might just catch a glimpse of one of these large beasts or some other charismatic forest inhabitant like the fox, European wildcat, roe deer, deer, wild boar and chamois, or even the charming otter on your walk along the river Kupa."
54,Gorski Kotar,Three large carnivores of Gorski Kotar,"Forests are the realm of three large carnivores: the lynx, the wolf, and the bear. The lynx is a cautious and elusive animal. Very few people are lucky enough to see a lynx in the wild. They stalk and ambush their prey, hiding in high rocks or a fallen tree trunk. Wolves are family-oriented animals that roam large distances with other members of their family, or pack. They are naturally timid and stay away from humans, so a wolf roaming the forest is as rare a sight as a lynx. The bear is the real master of the forest. Although they belong to the carnivore family, meat is only a small part of their diet. They roam the forest and meadows in search of delicious herbs like bear's garlic or arum, as well as fruits and forest fruit trees such as beechnuts, raspberries or blackberries. Their menu also includes insect larvae and carcasses of prey animals killed by wolves or lynxes. Bears are proud owners of the best sense of smell of any forest animal, and scavenging leftovers after hikers and other recreationists (even biodegradable waste we often leave behind in the forest) often leads them to human settlements, and into trouble."
54,Gorski Kotar,Western capercaillie,"The western capercaillie, found only in a small area of Gorski Kotar (mostly above 1000 metres), is a bird restricted to old, natural and preserved forests. The world's largest grouse, it is currently one of the most endangered bird species in Croatia. The massifs of Risnjak and Snježnik are an important habitat and nesting site of the western capercaillie. Their numbers are in decline due to human disturbance, habitat fragmentation and loss of natural forest stands, highlighting the role of protected areas, as well as preserved natural and old forests, as refuge habitats important for their conservation. Hearing the male capercaillie's call is somewhat of an unusual experience. The males live solitarily, apart from a brief period in spring when they gather at special mating grounds, or leks, attracting the attention of the females by singing and elaborate courtship display. Male and female birds are distinctly different in appearance, and the capercaillie is no exception. The subdued appearance of the female capercaillie allows it to blend almost perfectly with the forest floor, so as not to attract attention. This is important because the capercaillie is a ground-nesting bird."
54,Gorski Kotar,Butterfly Valley,"The Kupa Valley, more precisely the northern part of its upper flow, is also known as the enchanting ""Butterfly Valley"". In hydromorphological terms, it is a canyon with small basins, and due to its low altitude and the fact that it is deeply cut into the surrounding terrain, it has a significantly milder climate and warmer temperatures compared to the rest of Gorski Kotar. Around 60% of the butterfly species present in Croatia have been recorded in the area. The Lokvar lake is the most recognisable scenery of Gorski Kotar, with plenty of options for an active holiday or relaxation. One of the most recognisable sceneries of Gorski Kotar is the Lokvar lake, stretching all the way to the base of Risnjak. The 2.2-kilometre-long and 40-metre-deep lake is artificial, enclosed by tall mountain forests and massifs, offering a number of options for an active holiday, from hiking along the lake shore to swimming in it during the summer months. As one of the favourite destinations of fishermen, the Lokvar lake was the location where one of the largest trout in the world was caught! The gathering of mountaineers, hikers and cyclists called ""POJ and BOJ"" has been traditionally held by the Lokvar lake, and the race around the lake takes place on foot or on bike. The lake is the result of a 1954 dam construction which blocked the course of the Lokvar river. It is the ideal place to relax and have fun year-round.

The Risnjak National Park is an impressive mountain kingdom situated in Gorski Kotar, within reach of the Croatian coast. The enchanting Risnjak National Park, situated in the Gorski Kotar region, is covered in unique and rich forest communities. It encompasses the central area of the Risnjak and the Snježnik massifs, the scenic upper course of the Kupa River, with its source decorating the turquoise lake. The surface area of the park is 63.5 km2, and one of the specificities of this region is the fact that the clearance distance from the peak of Veliki Risnjak (1,528 m) to the sea covers mere 15 kilometres, while the same distance to the source of Kupa (321 m) covers 8 km. In summertime, the park is characterised by warm daytime temperatures with refreshing nights. Winters are cold and snowy, while springs and autumns are rainy. The Risnjak and the Snježnik mountain massifs form a unique ecological zone rich with flora and fauna and represent a bridge of sorts between the Dinara Mountain range and the Alps. This area is home to the wolf, the bear and the Eurasian lynx - three large European carnivores, as well as many other diverse animal species such as birds, reptiles and insects. Butterflies are both exceptionally beautiful and significant, and the enchanting Kupa River valley is also known as the ""Butterfly Valley"" owing to the concentration of these animals in the area. The Risnjak massif, considered one of the most beautiful Croatian mountains, is part of the Dinaric Alps and encompasses multiple mountaintops. The name of this mountain massif is a reference to the Eurasian lynx, known as ris in Croatian, which inhabits the area. The view of all four corners of the world stretching from the Veliki Risnjak peak will captivate all those who adore the vast expanse of nature. The view encompasses the Kvarner Bay with its islands, as well as the area of Istria, Bjelolasica, the Julian Alps and Velebit. The Snježnik karst mountain is just as attractive and rich in vegetation, and boasts the eponymous 1,506-metre-high peak. The Snježnik peak, with a view of all four corners of the world, is rocky and surrounded by stunning mountain wildflower meadows. The peak also offers one of the most wonderful views of the sea, leaving its visitors speechless! The area of Risnjak is one of the oldest Croatian national parks. It was declared a national park in 1953 at the proposal of Prof. Ivo Horvat, PhD, a renowned Croatian naturalist and researcher, and as of the beginning of 1997, it was expanded to include the Snježnik mountain and the Kupa River. The source of the Kupa River, a 10-hectare karst spring with its surroundings, is a hydrological and natural phenomenon which has been a protected natural monument since 1963. This is the source of one of the deepest Croatian springs and to this day, it represents one of karst's greatest mysteries. The source can be accessed by taking a longer, less straining trail from the north of the village of Hrvatsko or by tackling a shorter but more demanding serpentine trail from the village of Razloge. The stunning karst spring forms a 200-metre-long and 30-metre-wide lake, characterised by its fascinating turquoise colour. The administration building and the main entrance to the Risnjak National Park are located in the same place - the Bijela Vodica street in Crni Lug. The Park can also be accessed from the Kupa valley (Entrance ""Hrvatsko"", Kupari Private Centre) and through the Vilje area from the Gornje Jelenje pass. The Leska Educational Trail, with 23 stops and equipped with information boards, is the ideal destination for all types of visitors, but especially those unable to hike for longer periods of time or climb to one of the mountaintops.

58,Grožnjan,Dolina rijeke Mirne,"Drevna via Flavia, koja se od Buja spušta prema Puli, nailazi na svom putu i na rijeku Mirnu te je prelazi mostom poznatim kao Ponte Porton. Na tom prastarom mjestu, nekoć poznatom i kao Porta Porton, stoljećima se nalazila lučica u kojoj su obližnji žitelji razmjenjivali različitu robu. Bila je to Baštija, luka znana i kao ""palada Baštija"". Za vrijeme Rimljana Mirna je bila plovna sve dovde. Manja riječna plovila mogla su stići do kaštela Pietrapelosa, gotovo pod samu buzetsku utvrdu. Nakon niza stoljeća, riječno se dno podignulo, budući da nitko nije vodio računa o čišćenju kanala, tako da su sada ploviti mogle samo brodice ravnog dna. Korito Mirne ponovno je u red dovela Venecija kako bi mogla prevoziti drva iz obližnje šume, posvećene sv. Marku, a poznate kao Motovunska šuma. Kod mosta Ponte Porton nalazila se lugareva kuća, a s druge strane gostiona sa mogućnošću smještaja. Od tuda su kretale ceste za Vižinadu, Buje, Grožnjan, Kostajnicu, Završje, Livade, kaštel Pietrapelosa i Buzet. Na desnoj obali rijeke, oko 1 km nizvodno od mosta, smještena je crkvica Majke Božje od Baštije, četvrtastog tlocrta, s malom preslicom na pročelju i lopicom poduprtom stupovima. Građevina je bila jednostavnog izgleda, a na oltaru obogaćivala ju je pala s likom Majke Božje. Crkvica je u to doba bila važno religijsko mjesto ne samo za tadašnje mornare nego i za okolno stanovništvo koje je često dolazilo u procesijama. Tu su se sklapala mnoga vjenčanja. Crkva je u potpunosti obnovljena 1999.g. Nakon što je Venetska Republika 1797.g. propala, kanali su se prestali održavati, a livade su se pretvorile u močvare. Zavladala je malarija. Tek 1930.g. Kraljevina Italija izvršila je bonifikaciju doline i isušila močvare. Time je iskorijenjena malarija i omogućeno ponovno obrađivanje velikih plodnih površina. Riječni promet odumro je razvitkom cestovnog prometa. ."

Grožnjan - Grisignana Grožnjan je smješten iznad doline rijeke Mirne na brežuljku nadmorske visine od 228 metara. Srednjovjekovna urbana cjelina ostala je uglavnom nedodirnuta do danas. Ona je prirodna osnovica za intenzivan i zanimljiv život koji Grožnjan danas živi. Pozivamo vas da ga podijelite sa nama. Od mora udaljen petnaestak kilometara oduvijek je bio privlačan za nastanjivanje. Od 1358. godine Grožnjan ima status slobodne općine. Pedesetih godina upravo prošlog stoljeća postaje dio općine Buje. Od 1993. godine ponovno dobiva status općine. Pored hrvatskog i talijanskog jezika koji su u službenoj uporabi, te slovenskog koji ne predstavlja problem na ulicama grožnjana čuju se i mnogi drugi svjetski jezici. Kulturni spomenici Grožnjana: KAŠTEL prvi put se spominje 1102.godine. Sjedište feudalaca a od 1359.g. je boravište mletačkih kapetana i podestata. S južne strane su vidljivi tragovi pregradnji. Današnji oblik je iz 19. st. U njemu se nalazi koncertna dvorana, središte glazbenog života Međunarodnog kulturnog centra Hrvatske glazbene mladeži. ŽUPNA CRKVA SV. VIDA, MODESTA I KREŠENCIJE prvi se put spominje 1310.g. U sadašnjem obliku je pregrađena u razdoblju 1748-70. Barokne korske klupe su iz 1711.g. Na oltaru Sv. Blaža nalazi se slika Franceska Travia iz 1716.g. Gradski zvonik sagrađen je u godinama 1603-1682.g. a visok 36 m. FONTIK S LOĐOM Gradska lođa se spominje već u 14.st. U današnjoj zgradi iz            1597.g. bio je sud i zatvor, dok se na prvom katu nalazilo skladište žitarica, u kojem su se čuvale gradske mjere i utezi. Danas se u njoj nalazi gradska galerija „Fontikus""."
58,Grožnjan,GRADSKA VRATA,"iz 15.st. ukrašena su grbovima mletačkih rektora iz 15. i 16. st. U zgradi s desne strane vrata  nalazila se 1360.g. „Hosteria"", gostionica za vojnike. CRKVA SV. KUZME I DAMJANA izgrađena 1554.g. PALAČA SPINOTTI-MORTEANI datira  iz 1681.g. Barokna palača gradskih notara i veleposjednika."
58,Grožnjan,PISARNA,"nekadašnje sjedište općinskih bilježnika, izgrađena 1492.g. Na gornjem baroknom dijelu još su vidljivi tragovi dekoracije. STARA KOVAČNICA iz 1406.g. Zgrada je bila u vlasništvu grada a iznajmljivali su je kovačima. KUĆA KORNER na starijoj osnovi izgrađena renesansna kuća iz 1567.g. CRKVICA SV. NIKOLE uz groblje izgrađena je u 19.stoljeću. KAPELICA SV. DUHA iz 16.st., pregrađena je 1799.g."
58,Grožnjan,Kostanjica,"Skrenemo li kod Ponte Portona s carske ceste Via Flavia, nailazimo na put koji se uspinje brežuljkom, gdje još uvijek postoji grobljanska crkvica sv. Stjepana, s dijelom drvenog oltara koji je pripadao drevnoj crkvi sv. Antuna, iz 14. ili 15. stoljeća. Na sredini groblja izdiže se veliki križ s brončanim Kristom. Na skretanju za Kostanjicu drugi put vodi do Biloslava, sela u kojemu se nekoć nalazila istoimena postaja željezničke pruge ""Parenzane"".U dokumentima u kojima se spominju dobra što ih istarski markiz Ulrich II. 1102. poklanja akvilejskoj crkvi, Kostanjica se navodi kao villa de Castan. Nakon što je pred kraj 13. stoljeća darovnicom prepušten istarskim grofovima, taj feud dijelio je zajedno sa Završjem, kojemu je pripadao, sva povijesna događanja iz stoljećâ feudalnog sivila. Ostaci obrambenih zidina, kojima je Kostanjica bila opasana, vidljivi su na strani okrenutoj prema dolini. Nakon groblja puteljak se spušta prema drevnome selu Kostanjici. Mjesto je naseljeno od antičkih vremena, o čemu svjedoče pronađene grobnice i natpisi iz rimskoga doba. Župna crkva posvećena je Blaženoj Djevici Mariji te sv. Petru i Pavlu, a na njoj čitamo natpis ""Electamus Genoa 1769"". Iznova je sagrađena 1500., a proširena u godini koju donosi natpis. Ima tri oltara, od kojih je najveći od mramora, s kipovima sv. Petra i Pavla. S vanjske strane ugrađene su dvije barbarske glavice koje su podupirale rebra u svodu ranijeg prezbiterija. Pred crkvom izdiže se venecijanski zvonik, od pješčanika, četvrtaste baze te osmerokutnog tambura i šiljka. Na luku čitamo godinu 1766. Selo je gotovo sasvim napušteno, a nešto života održalo se jedino uz glavnu cestu. Kuće odaju zanimljive arhitektonske pojedinosti, seoske i prepoznatljivo istarske, kao što su dugi balkoni, terasice i vanjske kavade za pečenje i kuhanje. Krajem 14. stoljeća, pod austrijskom vlašću, u susjedna sela doseljene su vlaške porodice. Venecijanci je zaposjedaju 1510., a Wormskim ediktom iz 1521. taj im je posjed i službeno priznat. U Veneciji je 1530. feud Kostanjica stavljen na dražbu, pa zajedno sa Završjem i Berceniglom postaje vlasništvom Venecijanca Giustignana Contarinija, čija ju je obitelj držala do 18. stoljeća. Nekoć je postojala i istoimena obitelj Castagna, čiji je grb na jednoj kući i danas vidljiv. Nakon kuge iz 1630. Venecijanci su potaknuli doseljavanje niza hrvatskih porodica iz Dalmacije i ostalih krajeva."
58,Grožnjan,Parenzana,"Gradnja pruge započela je u svibnju 1900. nakon što su se sve zainteresirane strane usuglasile oko konačne trase. U početnom projektu pruga je trebala imati trasu Trst-Poreč-Kanfanar . No, problemi s financiranjem koji su pratili projekt od samoga početka doveli su do toga da trasa od Poreča do Kanfanara nikada nije završena. Duljina trase iznosi 123,1 km, širina kolosijeka iznosila je 760 mm. Prva dionica od Trsta do Buja puštena je u promet 1. travnja 1902. Svečano otvorenje druge dionice od Buja do Poreča bilo je 15.12.1902. Trasa parenzane vrlo je zavojita, usječena u padine pitomih istarskih brežuljaka, prilagođavala se oblicima terena. Duž trase prokopano je 9 tunela ukupne dužine 1530 m. Najzahtjevniji za izvedbu je bio tunel Lucan dužine 544 m, a slijedili su nešto manji tuneli Motovun, Šaleta, Kalcini, Freski, Kostanjica, Sv. Vid, te dva mala tunela Završje I i Završje II. Od ostalih građevina treba istaknuti 16 mostova i 6 vijadukata, te veći broj propusta i nadvožnjaka. Svojom dužinom od 79,10 m ističe se vijadukt Antonci s pet otvora i najvećim rasponom od 12 m, te nešto manji vijadukt Oprtalj od 75,24 m. Vijadukti su građeni od kamena s polukružnim lukovima položenim na masivne kamene stupove. Zadnja vožnja Parenzane bila je 31.08.1935., a nakon toga je prugu Musollini dao razmontirati, ukrcati na brod i odvesti u Etiopiju za potrebe osvajačkih ratova. Sudbina je htjela da brod nikada nije stigao do Abisinije, već je potonuo na sredini Sredozemnog mora. Šterna Smještena na pitomom platou ispresijecanom vodenim tokovima. Oblast Šterne bila je nekoć vrlo velika. Uključivala je Kuberton, Topolovec, Kućibreg, Čepiće i Gradinju. U starini je bila poznata kao Grožnjanska Cisterna jer je i pripadala Grožnjanu. Toponim Šterna kraći je oblik od Cisterna, a potječe od nepresušnog izvora koji ovdje napaja šest jaraka u dolini sjeverno od crkve. 1067. ovaj je feud, tada poznat kao Steina, njemački car Henrik IV. ustupio biskupu Freisinga. 1102. markiz Ulrich II. daruje Šternu akvilejskoj patrijaršiji, koja daje u feud novigradskom biskupu. Patrijarsi Šternu ustupaju 1260. Almerichu XXX. iz Svetog Juraja na Mirni. Zatim prelazi goričkim grofovima, a polovicom 13. stoljeća postaje dijelom momjanske gospoštije. Kada je 1358. Venecija kupila Grožnjan s čitavom Grožnjanštinom, i Šterna je postala venecijanskim posjedom. Pošto je 1420. Venecija osvojila patrijarhov dio Istre, Šterna prelazi pod upravu Pietrapelosa, a 1564. dijelom postaje feudom obitelji Gravisi, a dijelom obitelji Del Bello. Tijekom rata između Venecije i Cambraiske lige, koji je potrajao od 1508. do 1516., Šterna stradava od čestih napada plaćeničkih skupina obiju vojski. Mjesto se nalazi na visini od 304 metra, a naseljeni dio nešto je uzdignut u odnosu na crkvu smještenu u blagoj udolini kraškoga tla. Neožbukane kuće dijelom su izgrađene od sivog pješčanika, a dijelom od bijelog vapnenca. Šterna je mjesto do kojega se stiže cestom što pred Kaštelom, približavate li mu se s južne strane, skreće nadesno. Ta cesta jasno razdvaja sjeverni laporasto-pješčanički pojas od južnog vapnenačkog.Župna crkva bila je u prošlosti prostrano zdanje i bile su joj podložene crkve na pripadajućem joj području. Zvonik je podignut 1791., a na njegov osmerokutni tambur nastavlja se stožasti šiljak. Crkva je odvojena od zvonika, sagrađena je 1746., o čemu svjedoči natpis na bijelom arhtiravu, a 1753. posvetio ju je novigradski biskup Leoni. Šterna je u Na sjeveru, na visini od 383 metra, nalazi se groblje s crkvom sv. Kancijana, produžena 1885. U unutrašnjosti, lišenoj ukrasa, nalazimo samo veliko raspelo i jednostavan oltar s dragocjenim drvenim retableom s kraja 16. stoljeća. 1525.g na poziv Venecije doseljavaju se slavenske obitelji koje obrađuju zarasla polja te zanatlije iz Furlanije i Karnije. U upravnom smislu Šterna je pripadala Općini Grožnjan sve do svršetka Drugog svjetskog rata, tako da je kroz naredna stoljeća dijelila povijest Grožnjana, osim razdoblja od 1947.g.. do 1954.g. jer je Šterna Pariškim Mirovnim sporazumom iz 1947.g. odmah pripala FNR Jugoslaviji, a Grožnjan je do 1954.g. pripadao zoni B Slobodnog teritorija Trsta. Šterna je sada područje poduzetnika i poljoprivrednika. Nedaleko mjesta Šterna smjestila se ‘Istarska pustinja', koju čine ""dine"" od lapora ili tašela, kako se u Istri često naziva tu sitnozrnatu sedimentnu stijenu. Iako u Istri, naročito u njenom središnjem i sjevernom dijelu, često nailazimo na ovakve dijelove krajolike, ovdje je riječ o jedinstvenoj koncentraciji ovakvih oblika na prilično velikoj površini. Dok se par kilometara od naselja Šterne-Filarija nalazi i ponor Butori. Taj jedinstveni ponor guta vodu Jugovskog potoka koja se prikuplja sa sliva površine 5,71 km2, a duljina glavnog vodotoka iznosi 5,33 km. Jugovski potok preko slapa pada u vrtaču na kameni odron i stvara 10 m dugo i 6 m široko jezero. Iz jezera voda otječe između odronjenih stijena gdje ponire te silazi 215 m niže i nestaje u završnom sifonu. Na proplanku kraj ponora svake godine početkom kolovoza održava se međunarodni pjesnički susret Šumski pjesnici. Kad padne noć, pjesnici i publika sjede na travi i čitaju poeziju uz krijes do kojeg vodi puteljak osvijetljen lučicama i bakljama.

Every sacred building along the way carries its own unique peace, a place where you can rest in moments of silence, contemplation, and introspection. The sound of footsteps on old stone, the scent of pine in the air and the gentle breeze - all of these create an atmosphere that calms and connects you to something greater than yourself. This hiking route that connects the sacred sites of Grožnjan is the perfect place for anyone seeking deeper meaning in their journey, whether through spiritual exploration, physical activity, or simply seeking beauty in the simple yet powerful experiences this region offers. Umjetnička tradicija Bogati program nudi skoro svakodnevne koncerte, otvorenja izložbi, performanse, posjete likovnim radionicama i atelijerima. Grožnjan danas njeguje bogatu umjetničku tradiciju. Likovna i muzička umjetnost zastupljene su u najboljem mogućem obliku: stvaralačkom na licu mjesta. Posebnu živahnost gradu daje činjenica da mnogi umjetnici svih profila žive i rade u Grožnjanu ili na teritoriju općine. Završje Sred laporasto-pješčaničkog pobrđa kojim na jugu, između Grožnjana i Oprtlja, završava Kras, ugnijezdilo se na 240 metara visokom brijegu Završje. Bilo je to oduvijek poljoprivredno mjestašce obrađenih njiva, maslinika i voćnjaka, ali štavila se tu i goveđa koža za izradu obuće. Gradić je bio opasan dvostrukim zidinama, koje su i danas dijelom vidljive, a kroz njih su prolazila dvoja vrata, od kojih se danas razaznati mogu samo jedna. Nad vratima su drevni bareljefi i grb obitelji Contarini, koja je ovim feudom vladala tri stoljeća. Popločana uličica vodi na uzvišicu s drevnom crkvom Blažene Djevice Marije sv. Krunice i zvonikom. Crkva ima kružnu apsidu i portal zašiljenog luka, s godinom 1879., kada je posljednji put rekonstruiran. Sagrađena je u 16. stoljeću, a obnovljena 1634., pri čemu su od ranija četiri drevna oltara ostala dva. Imala je srebrne svjetiljke i svijećnjake iz 18. stoljeća, te veličanstven pehar s ocakljenim medaljonima iz 1476. Crkva ga je krajem 18. stoljeća prodala pa je završio u Rotschildovoj zbirci. Danas se nalazi u pariškome Louvreu. Gotička pokaznica potječe iz 1849., a na njoj su prikazani Djevica Marija, sv. Ivan evanđelist i Krist koji izlazi iz groba. Do crkve smješten je veličanstveni kaštel Završje, sagrađen u 11. stoljeću i poznat kao palača plemenitih Contarinija. U unutrašnjosti se nalazi kućica na kojoj čitamo natpis ""Hosteria di Valentino Valle"". Sagrađena je 1579. Pred sjevernim vratima sagrađena je velika crkva sv. Ivana i Pavla, nova župna crkva, obnovljena 1792. Krase je četiri lezene, a apsida je kružnog oblika. Ima pet oltara i bogato je ukrašena. Oltar Blažene Djevice Marije sv. Krunice 1792. poklonio je crkvi plemić Besenghi. S bočne strane krova izdiže se mala preslica od pješčanika. Prema dolini, prije sačuvanih gradskih vrata, nalazi se crkvica iz 1556., posvećena sv. Roku, a na oko 1 km sjeverno od župne crkve groblje s crkvicom sv. Andrije. Završje je bilo nastanjeno još za davnih stoljeća, o čemu svjedoče pronađeni predrimski predmeti, kao i rimske grobnice i natpisi. Pronađeni su i tragovi navodno prve konzulske ceste koja je prolazila unutrašnjošću Istre. Uz nju je 1885. otkrivena nadgrobna ploča na kojoj se spominju razne povijesne ličnosti. Drevno ime ovog srednjovjekovnog gradića čuva se u talijanskom obliku Piemonte. Pod njime je poznat još od 1102., kada ga je istarski markiz Ulrich II. darovao akvilejskom patrijarhu. U dokumentima iz 1341. i 1508. spominje se kao Pyamont ili Poymont. Nijemci su ga 1427. nazvali Pemund. 1300. Završje je pripadalo pazinskim grofovima. Zatim ga zauzima Venecija, koja se morala oduprijeti hrvatskim jedinicama krčkoga grofa. 1360. Završje su bezuspješno napale tršćanske snage patrijarha Lodovica de' Della Torrea i njihova biskupa Negrija, budući da su ovi u to doba bili u ratu s pazinskim grofovima. 1374. mjesto dolazi pod Austrijsku vlast i biva uzdignuto na položaj feuda. Na njegovom je čelu sada kapetan, ima zasebnu upravu, vlastiti urbar i načelnika. U to vrijeme, krajem 14. stoljeća, započinje polagano doseljavanje hrvatskih porodica na to područje. Gospoštiju Završje austrijske su vlasti ustupale uz godišnju pristojbu, pa su se tu izmijenili mnogobrojni vlasnici. Nakon 1412. Završje je više puta napadala Venecija, tijekom ratova koje je vodila protiv Mađara, Turaka i Austrijanaca. To je potrajalo do 1511., kada ga je i službeno zauzela. Pripojenje je međutim ratificirano tek Wormskim mirom. 1530. gospoštija Završje stavljena je u Veneciji na dražbu i dodijeljena Giustignanu Contariniju. Njegovi nasljednici držali su ga do 19. stoljeća. Tada je potpao pod Napoleonovu vlast, a nedugo zatim pod Austriju. Dobro organizirana Austrijska vlast donijela je prosperitet ovom kraju, pogotovo izgradnjom uskotračne željezničke pruge ""Parenzana"". Razvitak trgovine pridonijelo je intenziviranju poljoprivredne proizvodnje, posebno voćarstva i povrtlarstva. Obrtništvo je također doživjelo procvat. Za vrijeme vladavine Austrijskog carstva kao i Republike Italije Završje je imalo poštu, školu, dvije trgovine, uljaru i razne druge obrte. 1943.g. antifašistički pokret zahvatio je i Završje, hrvatski i talijanski antifašisti zajedno su se borili protiv njemačkog okupatora. Pariškim Sporazumom o miru sa Italijom Završje je pripalo FNRJ Jugoslaviji. Zbog ekonomskih i političkih razloga uslijedilo je masovno iseljavanje, tako da od nekadašnjih devedeset obitelji sada u samom gradiću živi četrdesetak stanovnika. Ovaj bedemima i kulama opasani gradić zapanjuje arhitektonskom izvrsnošću svojih zdanja. Nezaobilazno je odredište svakome tko želi proputovati Istrom s ciljem da razgleda i upozna njezinu povijest i kulturu. Muzej narodnih glazbala u Završju (MU=BAJS) je otvoren u travnju 2016.g. u kojem se nalaze narodna glazbala ove složene i raznolike regije u kojoj je Povijest donijela razne jezike, običaje, navike, religije, poslovice i glazbene izričaje. Na ovim prostorima rodio se Ottavio Stocovaz - Rapatočki, narodni glazbenik i izrađivač bajseva, bassetta, lirona, lerona, kojemu je posvećen muzej narodnih glazbala, i to ne samo zbog njegove izrađivačke aktivnosti, već i zbog toga što je uspio okupiti mlade da nastave njegov put glazbenika i izrađivača glazbala.

60,Krapina-Zagorje County,Krapina-Zagorje County,"Many people will think of green color when mentioning Zagorje. There are some who will associate Zagorje with wines, and many will remember it for popular songs that gently glorify and magical """"green hills"""". Gourmands will praise local dishes, the most famous of which are ""štrukli"" (dough usually filled with cottage cheese mixture), and history lovers will be happy to point out that many Croatian notables, artists and rebels were born in Zagorje, and that one hundred thousand years ago Krapina's Neanderthal man found his home there. It could be said that Zagorje has been a top destination since the Stone Age."
61,Hvar,Hvar,"The town of Hvar is a unique blend of luxurious Mediterranean nature, rich and diverse cultural and historical heritage, and a contemporary world known tourist destination. The island of Hvar is the longest and sunniest Croatian island. Covered with pine trees, it makes a pleasant climate even for vineyards. Numerous picturesque beaches, crystal clear sea, plenty of sunshine, rich cultural and historical heritage, the smell of lavender, olives and wine are the reasons why the island of Hvar is so widely known. The turquoise sea will immediately attract you. You can gently enter the sea at one of the pebble beaches or even jump of a cliff. A visit to the Blue and Green Caves, the natural phenomena of the sea will surely enchant you and stay in your memory forever because of the wonderful play of light and colour. The golden age of the Hvar theatre began in 1612 with its erection and the fact that it survived and operated for more than 400 years. This military structure consisted of towers, loopholes, cannons... It saved the Hvar people from the Turkish invasion, survived an explosion and was completely restored in the 19th century. The ""ethno-eco"""" villages, above all, are ideal for relaxing in peace and quiet - places that are only """"disturbed"""" by pleasant sounds of nature. And while you enjoy the taste of the last figs this year, feel the peace and quiet of autumn in the town of Hvar."
62,Ičići,STONE,"Three decades ago, the people of Ičići placed a rustic stone with a mysterious inscription in Tivoli Park. Since then, the stone has fired the imagination, not only of the residents of Ičići but also that of every park visitor who stumbles upon this irregularly shaped stone block with its row of carved signs. The stone was discovered in the garden of the Prpić family of Ičići in the foundations of an old wall that used to demarcate the gardens of the Southern Railway Company. It is assumed that it is a boundary stone, used in ancient times to mark property boundaries. Mrs Dolores Prpić Dekleva donated the stone to save it from falling into oblivion. Research has so far established that the inscription mentions the year 1487, and ends with the year 1697, which probably indicates the year when the stone was set. It is assumed that the stone was originally located along an old path that led from Veprinac to the coast. It is possible that it is based on a document whose text was transferred to the stone in an abbreviated form. To this day, the inscription, composed of a series of complex abbreviations, remains a mystery. Source: Ranko Starac, archaeologist"
62,Ičići,JARDIN TIVOLI - TIVOLI PARK,"Jardin Tivoli can be considered the birthplace of the hospitality industry in Ičići. A certain Mr G.E. Barth was the owner of a villa opposite Tivoli Park, which is still located there today, if you look from the park across the main road. The villa, popularly known as Villa Barth, belongs to the protected historic core of Ičići. The first historical records of the building date back to 1905. In 1910, it was renovated and served as the Hotel Tivoli for a while. In Tivoli Park (at the time Jardin Tivoli), there was a Wiener Cafe-Restaurant, whose owner was also Mr G.E. Barth. Back then, it was important to see and be seen. Ladies and gentlemen walked along the Lungomare hand in hand and refreshed themselves in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Tivoli Garden with a cup of tea or coffee. It was a place where people used to meet and get together with neighbours, friends and family. The construction of this villa (known today as Bamba) was ordered by Pavao Tomašić in 1910. The designer was the famous Austrian architect Carl Seidl. The villa had 8 large and 6 smaller rooms and 16 side rooms, a basement with a washing and drying room and rooms for servants, as well as a tunnel leading to the sea. The villa was already at that time rented out to guests. In its spacious lobby still stands the concert piano on which composer and conductor Boris Papandopulo and pianist and music teacher Melita Lorković played. During World War Two, the villa housed a German command and a prison. In 1964 it was bought by Mate Vrvilo, who renamed it Bamba: a name that would be audible and understandable to everyone, especially foreign guests Villa Barth (Tivoli Guesthouse) is located in the historic centre of Ičići. The first historical records concerning the villa date back to 1905. In 1910, the villa was converted into the Hotel Tivoli. At that time, the owner of the villa, the hotel-guesthouse and the bar in Jardin Tivoli was the Mr G. E. Barth mentioned above. We can consider the Jardin or the Tivoli Park as the beginning of the hospitality industry in Ičići. It housed a Viennese coffee house and restaurant owned by G. E. Barth. It was a time when it was important to see and be seen. Ladies and gentlemen used to walk, hand in hand, along the Lungomare promenade, stopping for refreshments in the shade of the trees in the beautiful Tivoli garden. It was a popular place for family outings, where people would meet with their neighbours and friends. After World War Two, the villa was converted into a residential building. Villa Florida was built more than 100 years ago. It is located right next to the Lungomare coastal promenade. It was renovated in 2007, retaining its centuries-old splendour that combines the past and the present. One of the most significant and attractive villas on the Opatija Riviera is the one built by Jakob Ludwig Münz, the owner of a quarry in South Tyrol, who named the villa after his wife. The tower on the villa is similar to that of the cathedral in Ulm, his native city. In 1948, the villa was nationalised, for which the owners received 12 wagons of oranges as compensation. It is interesting that during World War Two Italian soldiers, for the needs of the war industry, tore down almost all the fences from local buildings, except for the fence of Villa Münz. It is believed that the reason for this is the Swiss roots of the Münz family. A beautiful historical villa, located in the grounds of the former lung hospital. According to tradition, this is the oldest villa in the area, constructed between 1836 and 1840; this would make it older than Opatija's Villa Angiolina, though it has still not been confirmed. It is assumed to have been built by Captain Andrejčić; later it was bought by the Austrian Southern Railways Society (k.k. privilegierte Südbahn-Gesellschaft), Austria-Hungary's largest private railway company, based in Vienna. The park that surrounded the villa was one of the most beautiful parks on the Opatija Riviera. The villa has been preserved to this day and is scheduled to become part of a new hotel complex. Yacht Club Croatia (YCC) was founded in 1987 by Veljko Barbieri, who is also the founder of ACI (Adriatic Croatia International Club). Mr. Barbieri's passion for sailing and maritime affairs, as well as his vision for Croatia to become a recognizable destination on the nautical scene, resulted in the founding of the club that has become a symbol of sailing sport on the Croatian coast. As one of the most important moments in the club's history, its members mention the organization of the ACI Match Race regatta, where the Maxi cruiser ACI No. 1 sailed under the YCC flag and achieved excellent results in several international regattas, thus confirming the club's reputation on the global scene. Yacht Club Croatia has been passing on its love for the sea and sailing to young talents for many years. The club's focus is on the education and development of young talents through continuous sailing schools. By passing on knowledge about sailing, generations of sailors have acquired not only basic knowledge but have also become true masters in sailing. The achievements of its alumni further cement the school's success. Several champions, both nationally and in Europe, took their first hesitant steps on the water right here in Ičići."
63,Igrane,Igrane,"The town of Igrane is located in the safe embrace of the Biokovo mountain and the Adriatic Sea. This hidden gem of the Makarska Riviera is ready to show you all of its secrets, such as a bell tower reaching to the skies, beaches bathed in warm sunlight and fragrances of the south."
63,Igrane,Gastro,"After an active day, it is best to enjoy the tastes and smells of Dalmatia through carefully prepared dishes from our local caterers and a drop of top quality wine with the smell of the sea. The catering gastro offer in Igrane consists of restaurants that, in addition to the standard gastronomic offer, also prepare traditional Dalmatian dishes seasoned with olive oil and spices from Biokovo. In addition to restaurants, there are also other catering facilities with a classic offer of ""fast"" dishes, cafes and pastry shops. The symbols of Dalmatian cuisine are olive oil, Dalmatian prosciutto and salted fish in which you can feel the smell of the sea, the dryness of the wind and the life of Dalmatia. Eighty per cent of the Croatian coast is made from limestone, which has influenced a lot of the country's architecture. Until the middle of the 20th Century, houses were entirely built from the stone, water and sand, as these were the only materials they had available. Local legend has it that during one particularly strong wind (‘Bura'), an entire stone roof lifted off a house. You'll notice that many houses protect themselves from the ‘Bura' by having small windows and small holes which allow the wind to blow through the buildings, preventing it from getting trapped. They also act as air conditioning in the Summer! This defence tower (known as Zale's Tower) was built in 1668, to defend Igrane from the Turkish invasion, by  Ivan Antičić-Zale who is considered as a legendary hero of Igrane. The Tower was built as a fortification to defend Igrane from Turkish attacks and as a supply station for Croatian troops passing through. There are four levels within the building and many holes to position weaponry and allow for the ‘Bura' wind to pass through. The Igrane tourist board is planning to refurbish this now barren building into a multi-media centre to exhibit the vast heritage of the village. Right here where the rock kisses the sea and the wave cuddless with a shore, where the campanile bell announces a next dawn... as for us all and for you, stroller and traveller... So, 'till you get to know a Croatian name, all those Romans, Illyrians and Dalmat tribes have left their traces. During the 7th century a new history has been written, by the arrival of Croats and their flag adorns every church. In the 12th century Marković family of Krajina area managed to save „A Doclean monk Chronicle"" (Croatian Chronicle) that tells about Red Croatia, presents life and death of the King Zvonimir and stands for the one of the most important written document in the Croatian history. So, through the year 1466 a Croatian ruler Herceg Stjepan Kosača, for the first time mentions Igrane, a little village with 50 peasants. All those peasants, fishermen, builders and soldiers who defended and preserved, for us and for all the visitors, this playful jewel in the wreath of stone... snd the Tower of Zale Antičić and Tomica from the times of the battle against Ottoman Empire, not to forget baroque palace of Ivanišević-Šimić family and also a castle with a chapel... And what to say about the campanile that touches the sky, solid as a rock?! So, down there, a gardens and courts, houses and apartmens, almonds and flowers, vine cellars, restaurants, fishing nets and boats, white beaches and bays... bathing in the sunny stream. Anyway, take a good look, there's a Hotel „Punta"", like a point of desire awaits to embrace you with all its love...like a breez cuddles with every wave... With an opened hearth, Igrane calls you to its flourishing gardens. ""Be a knight by the deeds you do, not by the sword you carry."" Yes, Lucius Artorius Castus (King Arthur), a Roman general, lived and ruled these areas in the 2nd century, scientists confirm with many material evidences. Legend has it that before his death Arthur was looking for a place to put his sword. He called that place after his mother's name, Igrane. If you find that sword in the depths of the Igrane bay, it will certainly be of use to you only if you handle it in the way of love and kindness. The climate and geographical position of the Dalmatian region mean that at every turn you will find rich animal life and ecosystems while enjoying your vacation on pebble beaches lapped by sea waves. The sun-drenched coast is perfect for growing local tomatoes, pumpkins, rosehips, citrus fruits and other original Dalmatian plants. Laurel, oleander, bluebells, agave, myrtle and other wild plants fill the air with fragrance while you enjoy walks through nature. Igrane is well-known for olive cultivation and the village has now restored its olive groves and adopted modern techniques for processing the oil. This factory was built in 1908 and is still used by locals today. The oil is processed in October/November time when he olives are ripe and extra virgin olive oil is created using a technique called cold pressing. This is when olives are pressed to release their oils at a temperature no higher than 81.9 °F (27.7 °C). ‘Virgin oil' indicates that no heat or chemical additives are used to extract the oil from the olives, which can alter and destroy the flavours and aromas. Built in 1752, this 18th Century neo-Romanesque-style church appears similar to the Cathedral of St. Duje in Split. This is mainly because of its bell tower that was constructed in a similar way at a later date in 1925. It should have been taller than the bell tower in Split but the architect was forced to make it 2.5m shorter out of respect for Split being the regional centre for Church administration. The facade looks west. The church is a three-nave Romanesque building and is one of the few such churches in southern Croatia. On the front of the church, there is a small belfry built from the same material as the church, which proves that it was not upgraded later. The doors have ordinary stone jambs, and there is a round window (rosette) in the middle of the facade. In the interior, the western part is wider, and the eastern part is narrower and ends with a quadrangular apse. The church has a barrel vault, and the roof is made of stone slabs. The altar is a stone slab (menza) on a pillar, and above the altar is a semicircular niche. There is a sacristy next to the altar, and there is a narrow window on the southern wall. Next to the door is a pentagonal vessel for blessed water (sprinkler). During the tourist season, numerous cultural, entertainment and sports events are organized that complete the experience of the destination for all visitors. Fishing evenings are a traditional event where tourists can enjoy Dalmatian specialties, fun games and music. During the fishing evening, local producers present their products and tourists can taste Dalmatia and complete their experience."

64,Ilok,In Vicinity,"Almost all towns and villages between Ilok and Vukovar are set, or rather wedged, between the slopes of Fruška Gora and the banks of the Danube. The village of Šarengrad occupies this exact position. The impressive landscape with the church and monastery tower in the Gothic style on one side and the wide Danube on the other side, with the roofs of Šarengrad houses between, make a memorable sight. Šarengrad is a village of long history, which is witnessed by the fortress (Athya, Voćin) above the village and the riverbank which was built by the Viceroy Morovićki (in the 15th century), and the Gothic church and monastery of St. Peter and Paul. According to some data, there was a Templar house here as early as the 12th century. There are several explanations of the name of Šarengrad. The most convincing ones say that it came from the name of Sara (Sara's Town) or from the Hungarian name for Srijem: Szerenvar. Once a village of wealthy farmers, fishermen and tradesmen, Šarengrad is now faced with reconstruction of economic activities. When in Šarengrad, do not fail to visit ""Kapetanova kuća"" (the Captain's House), an interesting family farm situated on the very banks of the Danube. The village of Bapska, located some 15 kilometres from Ilok, is famous for its rich tradition and heritage and the prehistoric site of Gradac. According to the latest discoveries, the beginnings of life on this site go back to the 5th millennium BC, making this culture older than the Vučedol culture. The site of Gradac is included in the project of the Ministry of culture. After the research is completed, this settlement will be presented as it used to look in ancient times. Bapska was mentioned as a Catholic parish in the 14th century. There is a Romanesque church of the Virgin Mary - Our Lady of Bapska in the village, as well as a baroque church of St. George. Bapska is also interesting for the preserved tradition of rural life. The rich folk heritage of Šokadija and Srijem is best seen in the dances, songs, folk costumes and customs that have been passed on from one generation to another. Go to Bapska and discover a rural atmosphere interwoven with rich heritage."

64,Ilok,Restaurants,"The region of Ilok has always been a place of delicious and ample food. Tasty dishes and quality wines are an essential part of your host's table. The abundance of nature and a good position on the Danube have made it possible for peasants, tradesmen and ""gentlemen"" not to be short of anything and to become gourmets and culinary masters. The local cuisine is a mixture of the Slavonian and Austro-Hungarian culinary tradition, mostly richer, fuller in taste and spices, and desserts are never forgotten, especially on Sunday. Homemade brandy and numerous varieties of grapes of superb quality mark the beginning and end of each meal. These days, the menus at the Ilok restaurants offer some of the traditional meals: the Ilok ćevap (pork steak with a spicy sauce and mashed potatoes or the so-called dry ćevap with more onion and less sauce), čobanac (a kind of stew, mostly made of pork or beef or game), ""Bachelors' dinner"",sausage from Srijem, ham and so on.

64,Ilok,The Danube,"Living along the Danube River means living along the backbone of Europe and being connected with ten countries and an outlet to the sea, as well as being a part of the Croatian Danube basin which comprises Ilok, Vukovar, Baranja and Kopački Rit. Living by the Danube is a privilege, as the wide waters of the eternal Danube imply the luxury of nature, a ride by čikla (a kind of boat) and ferry, the wealth of freshwater fish and many other things that can only be experienced when you stand on its banks. An individual feature of the river banks along Ilok is Dunavac, a permanent backwater running between the Danube and the old town on the hill, which gives additional charm to the landscape and beckons us to keep fit, practise sports and enjoy nature. On the Ilok side of the Danube, there used to be a steamboat port more than 100 years ago, which was rebuilt after the Homeland War and exile. Today, this port is part of a recreational and tourist facility together with the promenade, beach, hotel and quay for passenger ships. The Danube has been celebrated in many songs, especially in the songs played by tamburitza bands, songs from the Srijem region and ballads. To experience it in the best possible way, come near its waters, listen to the sounds of nature and tamburitza, taste the fish specialities and, naturally, the wine. ""Oh, Danube, I left my heart by your banks"" are the words of a song that often come true, and many people who come find it very difficult to leave."
64,Ilok,The Ilok Wine Road,"For more than two millennia, Ilok and wine have been inseparable. The wine-growing hills of Ilok are a gift from God, and the wines in Ilok are also divine - of superior quality, bouquet and taste. Between the extraordinary soil and climate conditions and the wine stands a man: the wine-grower and worker, the Syrmian, who ""serves"" his vineyard all the year round so that later in his cellar he can cultivate a product which he will offer to his visitors hospitably. It is interesting that the wine cellars in Ilok are situated in the town. There is a winery/wine cellar in almost every street. The vineyards, on the other hand, are located on all the surrounding hills. This combination has created a special wine route which can be followed very simply. Naturally, one can also go as far as the vineyards and belvederes that can be found everywhere around the town. The winegrowers and wine-cellar owners have opened their doors to guests and offer them home-made snacks of cold meats and other delicacies, as well as anything else a visitor might desire and the host prepare. If you want to enjoy the hospitable family-like atmosphere and a glass of good wine, all you have to do is choose among some 12 winegrowers and announce your visit. Naturally, every visit has to include the attractive Old Cellars of Ilok (Stari ilocki podrumi) situated in the medieval town centre. They were built by the Princes Odescalchi in the 16th and 17th centuries. Today they are owned by the company Ilocki podrumi d.d. which belongs to the very top of the Croatian and European wine map. The grape varieties you can taste and buy in Ilok are: Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris, Rein Riesling, Silvanac and Traminac of the white wine varieties, and Pinot Noir, Frankovka and Cabernet Sauvignon of the red wine varieties. Ilok is especially famous for its traminac and silvanac, which were served at the English Court at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. A visit to the wine kingdom of Ilok is best finished off by a meat or fish meal in one of the local restaurants or a golf excercise in wineyards. If you have more time to relax, let yourself be entertained by the sound and songs of the tamburitza players (a string instrument). Contact the location you want, state your wishes and arrange a visit, and the winegrowers, members of the association Ilocka vinska cesta (Ilok Wine Road) will do their best to fulfil your wishes."
64,Ilok,The Medieval Old Town,"The medieval town of Ilok is a cultural and historical landmarked complex preserved by the national government. This small space makes it possible to travel back to the past and stroll through the centuries. Imagine a massive, lofty and elongated fortress, a prince and royal court, a church belfry rising high, a church and monastery with a tower, scattered Islamic buildings of the turbe and hamam, a lush park and public gardens, deeply buried old wine cellars, a belvedere with an unforgettable view of the broad Danube and the plains of Bačka - all of this can be seen and experienced in the medieval town of Ilok, on a small hill surrounded by the Danube and by vineyards. The old town is an inexhaustible source of material evidence of the life in this region which helps us to trace the continuity of living from prehistoric times to the Middle Ages and recent times. The oldest evidence testifies to the life in the Neolithic Age. In addition, there is valuable material evidence from the Roman period, when Ilok was called Cuccium, as well as a rich heritage dating back to the Middle Ages: the remains of St. Peter's basilica (dating from the 13th century) and the medieval castle, church and friary of St. John of Capistrano which were built by the Duke of Ugrin (dating from the 14th century), the fortress and walls erected by Nikola Iločki (dating from the 15th century). The period of Turkish rule produced the turbe and hamam (dating from the 16th century). The noble Odescalchi family left a castle and old wine cellars beneath the castle (between the 15th and 17th century). There is also the residence of Baron Brnjaković (dating from the 18th century), the chapel of St John Nepomuk (dating from the 18th century), and a beautiful park and public gardens (dating from the 18th and 19th centuries). The park harbours several busts and monuments which have been erected recently. Archaeological excavations, new sites, restoration and conservation works are a common sight in the old town. This location is a part of the project of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia called ""Restructuring, research and restoration of the site Vukovar - Vučedol - Ilok"". The research is planned to be finished and the most interesting finds presented by the end of 2010, when Ilok should be included in the list of towns and monuments of special value protected and promoted by UNESCO."
64,Ilok,The Odescalchi Castle -The Ilok town Museum,"The Odescalchi Castle is the central building situated in the medieval town of Ilok, housing the famous old Ilok cellars and the Museum of the Town of Ilok. The Odescalchi Castle is an impressive building built on the foundations of the castle of King Nikola Iločki from the 15th century. Nikola's medieval castle with the entire Ilok estate, which at the time occupied the greater part of Srijem, were given by Emperor Leopold to Pope Innocent XI Odescalchi and his family as a reward for their help in liberating Ilok from the Turks. The Pope's nephews, aristocrats from Italy, expanded the castle and changed its style. The castle was eventually rebuilt in the Baroque-Classicist style. They developed at the time very modern wine cellars beneath the castle and gave impetus to the growth of viticulture and wine production. After 1945, the Odescalchi left their Ilok estate, and their descendants remain a part of the Italian nobility, living near Rome. The castle and the entire medieval town of Ilok are today part of the project of the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia ""Restructuring, research and restoration of the site Vukovar - Vučedol - Ilok"". After the completion of the works, the Museum of the Town of Ilok is reopened with its archaeological, medieval, ethnographic and art collection and outdoor exibithion. Restoration of the castle was completed and inside the two floors is again Ilok City Museum with a new exhibition. Since February 2010.g open to visitors.

Die Iloker Festung hielt er für überaus wichtig, nicht nur aus strategischen, sondern vor allem aus religiösen Gründen... 'Dieser Ort ist zu halten. Wenn ihr meine Knochen bestattet habt, verlasst Ilok nicht!' Wir sind stolz darauf, dass unser Erbe auch diese Worte des hl. Johannes von Capestrano, des Apostels Europas, enthält. Sie bringen darüber hinaus das Gelübde der Iloke zum Ausdruck, seine Heiligkeit und seine ausnehmende Persönlichkeit zu ehren. In dem Wunsch, an der Grenze zwischen Ost und West eine sichtbare Spur der katholischen Religion und des Franziskanerordens zu hinterlassen, kam Capestrano in dieses Kloster, um zu sterben, in das Kloster mit Kirche, die sich über der Donau innerhalb der Festung des bosnischen Königs Nikola Iločki (Nicholas of Ilok) erheben. In Ilok werden die Franziskaner zum ersten Mal im 14. Jahrhundert erwähnt, als der Herzog Ugrin die Kirche bauen ließ. Zu Ehren und zum Ruhm des hl. Johannes von Capistrano wurde nämlich die Kirche nach seinem Tod von König Nikola verlängert und erneuert. Capestrano wurde 1690 zum Heiligen erklärt, und seine heute als Kapelle dienende Zelle, in der er 1456 gestorben war, ist im ursprünglichen Zustand erhalten. Heute wird sie von Pilgern und Neugierigen besucht; sie schöpfen dort die geistige und religiöse Kraft, die das Kloster und die Kirche ausstrahlen. Auch damals pflegten zahlreiche Prominente und einfache Menschen aus dem Volk den sterbenden Capestrano zu besuchen und sich vor ihm zu verneigen, was zu ersten Wunderheilungen führte, die auch nach seinem Tod an seinem Grab fortgesetzt wurden. Dazu besteht auch ein schriftliches Zeugnis, ""Die Wunder des Johannes von Capestrano"", in dem 100 solche Geschehen beschrieben werden. Dieser Text wird in der Pariser Nationalbibliothek aufbewahrt, während weitere Originalexemplare in Rom und im Vatikan aufbewahrt werden. Kopien von Capestranos persönlichen Manuskripten befinden sich in der Klosterbibliothek in Ilok. Das an die Kirche angelehnte Kloster wurde im Zeitraum vom 14.-20. Jahrhundert zu verschiedenen Zeitpunkten ausgebaut und erneuert. Die letzten Stiländerungen und die Erneuerung wurde von Hermann Bolle durchgeführt, u.zw. im neugotischen Stil, den er auch bei der Restraurierung der Zagreber Kathedrale angewandt hatte. Während des Krieges für die Selbständigkeit Kroatiens wurde die Kirche mehrmals von Raketen und Minen beschädigt.

64,Ilok,Viticulture and wine industry,"On the gentle hills of Fruška Gora, wine has been grown since Illyrian and Roman times. Since then, viticulture and wine production have been considered as one of the main economic branches of this area. The wine-growing hills of Ilok produce several quality wines. The Ilok Traminac is famous throughout the world, and is drunk at the Court of England. There is also Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Rein Riesling, Chardonnay, Frankovka and others. Numerous Ilok wines have won medals and have been capturing new markets. The biggest wine producer is ""Iločki podrumi"" d.d., which now owns the attractive old cellars beneath the Odescalchi castle. The number of small wineries is growing steadily. They have joined in ""the wine road of Ilok"", which offers the possibility to taste wine and home-made cured-meat produce and visit the cellars."
64,Ilok,Wines and Wine Cellars,"Wine growing and production have had an uninterrupted tradition of almost 1,800 years in the region of Ilok. In the 3rd century, after the Roman Emperor Probus abolished prohibitions that had been in force on wine growing and production in the Pannonian regions and introduced new quality varieties, the wine-growing hills of Ilok received an impetus for development. The Odescalchi dukes reaffirmed the position of Ilok as an important wine-growing region. In the 17th century, they built unique cellars underneath the Odescalchi castle, planted even more quality varieties and started bottling wine. These old cellars are used to the present day and represent one of the most interesting attractions of Ilok. In 1899, the Royal School of Viticulture was founded in Ilok, which later developed into the Agricultural School and today's High School for wine growers, wine makers and fruit growers. The wines produced by the company Iločki podrumi d.d., Traminac, Riesling, Pinot Blanc, Rein Riesling and Chardonnay are world-class wines, and the company itself has been among the strongest Croatian companies for a long time now. In addition, there is an increasing number of small and quality private wineries which focus on wine growing and wine tourism. Every visitor can choose to visit one of the typical cellars of Srijem in the hills or under the houses or experience modern wineries. Wherever you choose to go, you will be able to learn about the process of wine production and enjoy a cordial family atmosphere."
65,Imota,Imota,"Imotski is a dream carved into stone, a town straight out of a fairy tale, nestled amid the white stone slopes above the hidden water pits. Not many people know that the entire region of Imotska Krajina has an abundance of clean, potable water and that its beauty peaks in this awe-inspiring unexpected contrast of water and karst landscape. The gifts that nature has bestowed on this area prove without a doubt that God wanted to make some parts of the world truly magical. Imotski, the town of light, blazing on white stone like the Lord's burning bush, cannot be held back by dry stone walls or earthly dimensions, rather it pulsates in the heat of summer and evaporates over the Blue Lake, its calling is that of the falcon, as it raises towards the soft clouds and even beyond, before it swoops and plunges into the depths of its waters - Jauk, Utopišće, Opačac, Duboka draga, Dva oka, where the nimble fairies admire their reflections and dance - finally becoming one with the sleeping Vrlika and travelling further down the fields. It presents itself to the world showing off its magnificent Blue Lake, not far from the Red one, dressing itself in legends, eliciting emotions of admiration and disbelief from its visitors. Not to mention the lakes in Lokvičići! Or the canyon of Suvaja and Badnjevica! The world seems unreal, fantastical here. We will gladly tell you the story of the water rising from stone and all about our way of life. Join us and our beautiful water nymphs as we gently connect our paradise with the rest of the great big world that has yet to know us. And once you are faced with life's struggles, ill thoughts or adverse weather, remember that our little corner of the universe, tucked behind the mountain, among the tiny lake fairies, holds a place where you can heal. Welcome, we are expecting you!"
65,Imota,Badnjevice Fort,"Badnjevice Fort is a medieval multi-story fortification constructed in the Suvaja river canyon of the same name. It was built in the first half of the 15th century by Herceg Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, the Grand Duke of Bosnia. High above the fort, on the precipice of a rocky plateau, rises a tall square-shaped tower. Its location makes it very inaccessible, however it is one of the most impressive medieval fortifications in Dalmatia. At the southern end of the abovementioned canyon there is a hill called Kokića glavica, with the remains of a prehistoric hillfort and fortification dating from Late Antiquity. Below Badnjevica fort is a bridge across the Suvaja with its earliest construction elements dating from the 17th or 18th century. A statue of Christ the King is located next to the bridge."
65,Imota,Blue Lake,"Blue Lake is located at the end of the town, in a 300 to 500 meter deep crater. Its maximum length is 800 meters and the width 500 meters, but those dimensions change considerably, depending on the water level - the lake sometimes goes completely dry in summer. The water level oscillates, often reaching 100 meters. The highest, measured in 1914, reached 147 meters. The oscillations are due to estavels at the bottom of the lake, which act as springs during the rainy season and as drains during the dry season. The water is of a nice blue colour, which gave it its name. The access road leads almost to the bottom. In summer, the lake is the local population's favourite swimming pool and children play football at the bottom when it dries out, which is a special attraction. Unfortunately, the process of backfilling is well under way, especially obvious from the north side. The lake dries up more and more often, and it is with great attention and certain apprehension that the locals wait for the water to come back after the dry season. Many articles have been written about the lake and many songs have been sung, but to this day the words that would do justice to its beauty have not been found. For those who were growing up by the lake's shores, Imotski and Blue Lake are parts of the same existential paradigm. Spending summers by its waters, people have learned how to take responsibility: they protect the nature there or keep a wakeful eye on all children who cannot swim, even though they are not necessarily their own. Every lake-related experience is a good investment in the future. Children cannot learn anything wrong by its shores and when they grow up the lake brings them back to their childhood, refreshes them and renews them. Every summer we rediscover that same timeless beauty we left there the previous summer. The colour of the water varies from bluegreen to turquoise, depending on the water level and weather conditions. Chance travellers speak so nicely of the lake and those living in Imotski find it so natural that such a beauty befalls them by their very birthright. If you go for a swim over the shiny surface on a summer afternoon, look up towards the blue sky and all around you will see cliffs, rockslides, boulders, and protrusions convenient to jump from that only a divine force stops from swooping down. A ring of black pines on the horizon separates this water oasis in the middle of a boiling rocky ground from the outside world. The lake is so impressive that it is hard to articulate all the feelings that overwhelm you when you take your place on a rock and relax, your eyes erring with joy over the blue rippled water."
65,Imota,Cvit Razgovora,"Every year, the Association of Winemakers and Winegrowers of the Imotski Vineyards organizes the event ""Cvit Razgovora"" which brings together many Imotski winemakers and a large number of visitors from the Imotski region, Dalmatia and a large number of tourists staying in the wider area of Dalmatia. The intention is to promote the Imotski vineyards through this event, enrich the tourist offer of our region and invite visitors to visit the tasting rooms and wineries that participate in this event. By purchasing a glass, each visitor exercises the right to taste the wines offered in the wineries participating in the program."
65,Imota,Glumci u Zagvozdu,"Theatrical Encounters in Zagvozd (or Actors in Zagvozd) is a theatrical event that has been held since 1998. This summer theater festival is held every year in July and August in the Zabiokovo town of Zagvozd. Since its inception, this festival has hosted a number of famous cast members and drama actors. The founder, organizer and longtime artistic director of the festival is the actor Vedran Mlikota. http://www.glumciuzagvozdu.hr/"
65,Imota,Green Cathedral,"The Church of the Assumption at Durmiševac was built in 1873. Since the nearby church on Opačac, owned by the Franceschi family, was neglected for a long time, the Bishop of Makarska allowed the parish priest of Proložac to build a new church to celebrate the Assumption. Not far from the church, along the river Vrljika, in 1995, an ""outdoor church"" was built, the so-called Green cathedral - a structure with the outlines of a three-nave basilica with a sanctuary and a facade (designed by architect Edo Šegvić) - where a holy mass and procession is held for the feast of the Assumption. The whole area around Durmiševac and neighboring Opačac is a kind of ""Our Lady's Garden"" of the Imotski region- a place of peace, tranquility, gathering and prayer."
65,Imota,Homeland Museum Imotski,"Historical remains of Imotski and its surroundings are exhibited in two collections: one is placed in Franciscan monastery and the other one in Dogana.  The Franciscan collection contains nine separated collections - the most important ones being archaeological and ethnographic ones as well as painting collection with artworks dating from 17th to 20th century. In Regional collection, visitors can see archaeological remains, numismatics, ethnology and scenes from the town life. From recently, there is also Memorial room of writer and translator Dinko Štambak. Imota Bike & Wine Imota Bike & Wine đir 3.0, is a famous Imotski bike race during which you can taste the products of local winemakers, and is organized by the Tourist Board of Imota, the Association of Winemakers and Winegrowers of Imotski vineyards ‘Flower of Conversation' and ‘BIKE IM' Team. The recommended age limit for minors is 14 years, and all cycling participants under the age of 14 can participate in the cycling race only accompanied by a parent or guardian. For all participants in the cycling race under the age of 16, it is mandatory to wear a protective helmet, without which participation will not be allowed. See more information on the facebook page."
65,Imota,Imotska krajina,"Imotska krajina is a historical name for an area situated in the hinterland of the Biokova massif. In the past Imotska krajina included also the part bordering with Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the current demarcation originated with the peace Treaty of Passarowitz, which ended the conflicts between the Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire during the Second Morean War between 1714 and 1718. The fertile Imotsko polje (field) has had a key role in the life of this area. In between its almost flat surface and the Biokova massif (1762 m) there is a spacious karst area with a series of alternating hills and bays. The field and the karst area in its immediate vicinity abound in water. The Vrljika River flows alongside the entire field, and Prološko blato in its north-western part becomes a floodplain area during the cold season of the year. Thanks to them the field offers excellent conditions for agriculture. Several karst lakes for which Imotska krajina is well-known are situated in the karst area north of the field. Not far from Imotsko polje, on the slope of the Podi hill is situated Imotski. It developed from the medieval fortress which was the centre of the Croatian municipality and whose existence in the 10th-century was recorded by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos (τά Ημοτα). The rest of the important settlements were situated by the very edge of the field: Proložac (by the north-western edge) and Zmijavci and Runovići (by the south-eastern edge). Out of the settlements situated further away from the field, it is worth mentioning Zagvozd and the western villages - Studenci, Lovreć, Cista... Land area: 612 km2 Population: 29 721 (2011.) Population density: 48,5 p/km2 The area of Imotski is well-known for its tradition and culture. It is mentioned in the famous folklore ballad Asanaginica which has been translated into a number of European and world languages. The Imotski area is also famous for its ganga -a traditional type of singing which originated at the beginning of 20th-century. Ganga is a type of singing performed in a way that one singer sings verses and the rest follow him imitating the sound of gusle. Finally, Imotska krajina contributed greatly to 20th-century Croatian literature. The greatest credit for that deserves the great poet and writer Tin Ujević (1891 - 1955.)."
65,Imota,Imotska Sila,"The traditional summer cultural event that begins every year on July 4, the birthday of the great Imotski poet Tin Ujevic. The organizer is the Public Open University Imotski, and you can see more about this event on their official website pou-imotski.hr Lokvičići lakes The Imotski region is rich in lakes and karst holes. However, while Blue Lake and Red Lake are well-known in the world, many others, equally attractive but inaccessible by road, remain unknown. In the municipality of Lokvičići, which consists of five villages, there are three such lakes - Lokvičići (or Mamić Lake), Knezović Lake and Galipovac. The inhabitants of Imotski are well aware of their beauty. The three lakes form a unique whole with Proložac Lake on the opposite side and the part of the Imotski Valley called the Proložac Mire, flooded most of the year. During the winter months and in the early spring, springs from the Studenci and Ričice plateaus become richer in water and rains are abundant, so a huge amount of water flows into the west part of the Imotski Valley, increasing the surface of Proložac Lake, which pours into the Mire and floods 3 to 4 square kilometers. The depth of the Mire is 1 to 6 meters. Opposite Prološko Lake are Galipovac, Knezović, and Lokvičići lakes. The biggest and the most famous of them is Galipovac, located at the furthest northern point of the Imotski Valley. Its cliffs are extremely steep and it is easier to approach it through the lowest saddle on the edge of the Valley. Its dimensions are 170 by 115 meters and its depth over 60 meters, although it varies by 10 meters, depending on the season and the water inflow. The bottom of the lake is silty, but the water is relatively clear, except when the inflow is abundant. There are lookouts and resting places by the lake. To the south-west of Galipovac is Knezović Lake, a very steep and inaccessible hole. It is as hard to access as Red Lake and there are other similarities between the two, but Knezović Lake is smaller. The water in the lake is very clear and some 40 meters deep. The water level varies by ten meters in those three lakes, but they never go dry, so it seems that there is constant water inflow. All of them are at the edges of the Imotski Valley or the Mire and they are believed to be connected to it by underground waters. There are interesting sites around the lakes as well. All of the four lakes and the Mire are intertwined with holes, dry lakes, and the surrounding hills with scattered gardens, cascading vineyards, stone constructions and many archaeological sites."
65,Imota,Magic Time Vinyl Festival,"The Magic Time Vinyl Festival is a unique event in this area where only music from records is played. So a completely analog festival where vinyl reigns exclusively in all sizes and revs. The idea of the festival is to gather fans of gramophone records and DJs for two days and present music that is almost forgotten. You will certainly not hear most of the songs on the radio or on TV, not to mention discos and clubs. This is not to say that the songs are bad, on the contrary, even after 30, 40 years they still sound exciting, but under the onslaught of new commercial music they are simply buried in an avalanche of digital hyperproduction. We understand that time goes on and it is easier to click with the mouse than to look for small cracks on black vinyl, but in that forest instant super offers often miss us, especially if it is about songs from the last century. Old songs can be very exciting and we want to show that at this festival. We want to bring them back from oblivion, revive them, provoke nostalgia, make you dance and show the younger generations the richness and quality of music that was played in this area. Vinyl is a symbol of a different way of life and a different way of listening to music. There is no ""next"" or ""skip"" but A and B sides. There are no speed interceptions or shuffles, but listening to the records was a whole ritual equal to Japanese tea drinking. ""Let's listen to records here"" is a sentence that symbolizes those old times, and which can hardly be imagined in this digital modernity. Vinyl is also a symbol of musical evolutions - from jazz, twist, rock'n'roll, funk, disco, punk, the new wave... from the Opatija, Split festival, San Remo to underground clubs on the verge of the 90s. We want to merge and show all this at this unique analog festival. The festival venue itself also has that magical moment because it takes place in the middle of summer on dreamy meadows along the Vrljika River, close to the murmur of old mills and the legendary Perinuša. The whole natural environment, the clarity of the water, and the analog sound from the records, we hope, will enchant you as well... Welcome to the festival at 33 and 45 rpm. Monastery- Prološko blato At Prolosko blato there is an island called Manastir with the remains of a Franciscan monastery. The Franciscans lived here from the 16th to the beginning of the 18th century during the Ottoman rule over these regions. In 1715 on the eve of the last Venetian and Ottoman war the friars left this island forever. Several years after the end of the Ottoman occupation they founded a monastery at Imotski. Blato represents a lake which is under water for most of the year and the other part is dry or swamp. It is also a nesting ground for several fish species as well as a home to numerous birds (ducks, storks, ....). At the steep hilltop ""Grad"" Between the hidden villages of Mamići and Knezovići lies a Roman and medieval fortress used as a shelter in times of danger. Above the lake there is a group of prehistoric tombs from the Bronze Age."
65,Imota,Nature park Biokovo,"Biokovo is the highest mountain range in the coastal area of the Republic of Croatia. Biokovo's highest point, the St. George peak, is at an altitude of 1,762 meters above sea level. The unique geomorphology, exceptional biodiversity and mesmerizing beauty of the landscape have earned the Biokovo mountain range the status of a protected nature park. It is a part of the largest karst area in Europe - the Dinaric Alps, which is a globally known locus typicus of the specific karst morphology which creates the climatic and physical barrier between the coast and the hinterland, where the Lakes of Imotski are located. Perinuša Gadžo mill with its two millstones still works on the river Perinuša. During the Ottoman rule, several watermills were built and embankments and dams were made of gravel soil. The Franceschi family built several more mills in the 18th century and there were 14 millstones in total. Austria replaced the soil embankments and dams with stone ones, which still resist the destructive forces of water and time. The last miller still vividly remembers the old times, the sound of a millstone, the smell of white flour, the sweet corn mush ... From time to time people still mill some wheat, barley, or corn in the last remaining watermill. Not many crops are cultivated in the region any more, but the local population likes to mill them, more for the well-known taste than for any real economic benefit. Swallows still nest in the watermill and in the old villas by the bridge on the Perinuša. It is thought they nest only in places where good people live. Lot of insects ensure enough food for the nestlings and the sight is identical to that of hundreds of years ago: velvety swallows fly low, dragonflies of brocade colours float over the water and the sound of millstones and water rushing down the canals evokes happier times when life was concentrated around the mills on the Vrljika."
65,Imota,Red Lake,"Red Lake is a hydromorphological phenomenon, a world rarity because of its unique shape, colour, and genesis. It is located 1.5 km to the north-west of Imotski. It was formed when underground water pits collapsed and experts often call it a wonder of karst because it is an abyss with slopes resembling a natural well. It is some 200 meters in diameter and more than 500 meters deep, half of which is the depth of the water. Its bottom has not been entirely explored yet. Josip Roglić, a member of the Academy, carried out the first systematic morphological and hydrological research of Red Lake in 1937, but the data were not particularly accurate, since technology was not particularly advanced at the time. More accurate data on Red Lake were provided by engineer Milivoj Petrik, who published the results of his research in the 1950s. Petrik found the lowest point of the bottom at 4.1 m above sea level. He also determined the highest (274.5 m) and the lowest (252.8 m) water level. According to the morphological classification, Red Lake is the deepest pit in the Dinaric karst and water fills half of it. Moreover, it is one of the deepest speleological caves in the world that is constantly under water. The lake was protected in 1964 (and the whole area north of the town in 1971) as an important landscape. It encompassed Blue Lake and Red Lake as nature monuments, as well as a larger forested area covered with black pine. The first description of Red Lake dates from the beginning of the 18th century. Ivan Zuane Franceschi, a military officer from Venice, wrote a letter to his friend in 1717, after the liberation of Imotski from the Turks: I think I was even more terrified and impressed when I saw the second abyss (the first was Blue Lake; author's remark). It seemed as if an artist's hand had taken a hammer and a chisel to carve a big circle in bare stone on the almost flat top of the hill and cut it vertically, like a very deep well. The crater is more than half a mile in circumference, very steep (almost vertical), and its bottom has not been discovered yet. The stone is red with no bush or spring to appease those dreadful cliffs. When you see those chasms, you ask yourself in fear how they were created. Have they always been like that or did some underground volcano, now inactive, start spitting lava and underground rocks, thus creating those wide-open mouths? (La Dalmazia, no. 10, 1846) The legend says that Gavan's Estate (a rich man's castle) tumbled down into the lake when an angel dressed as a beggar warned the lady of the house of fairness and charity and she replied arrogantly: I don't need for your God, as long as I have my Gavan!, refusing to give him alms. At that moment the ground trembled and Gavan and his estate fell in the abyss. The abyss then filled with water and legends of evil supernatural beings whose howling can still be heard from the red crater even today. Friar Silvestar Kutleša wrote the legend down in 1937 and friars I. Despot and J.E. Tomić published it later. They also wrote down a folk song which explains the fall of Gavan's Estate into the abyss - Red Lake. The song has 25 verses written in the folk meter that contains eight feet (the feature lost in translation). They vividly portray a terrifying story of a punishment brought on by conceit, one of the greatest human flaws. Stećci With several hundred ""stećci"" over half of which are decorated, this is one of the top 10 archeological sites in Croatia and one of two Croatian sites with ""stećci"" on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The oldest part of the site are three early Bronze Age tombs related to the nearby prehistoric villages and forts. In the early 1st century the Roman legions built a road that is still in use today and that once served as a part of the Roman road network which connected Aquliea in Italy with Dirahij  in Albania. During the Middle Ages a  graveyard with ""stećci""  was built here. The repertoire of carvings is typical and it includes crosses, flower of lilies, scenes of hunting, dancing, dueling and more. Certain elements belong to the famous workshop of the blacksmith Jurina  from the middle 15th century and are easily identified by large flowers, arcades, warriors and horsemen. Two tombstones have inscriptions in the local version of the Cyrillic script.  South of Velika Crljivica lies a sinkhole with seven wells that were built during the 17th and the 18th century.

65,Imota,Topana Fortress,"Blue Lake is located at the end of the town, in a 300 to 500 meter deep crater. Its maximum length is 800 meters and the width 500 meters, but those dimensions change considerably, depending on the water level - the lake sometimes goes completely dry in summer. The water level oscillates, often reaching 100 meters. The highest, measured in 1914, reached 147 meters. The oscillations are due to estavels at the bottom of the lake, which act as springs during the rainy season and as drains during the dry season. The water is of a nice blue colour, which gave it its name. The access road leads almost to the bottom. In summer, the lake is the local population's favourite swimming pool and children play football at the bottom when it dries out, which is a special attraction. Unfortunately, the process of backfilling is well under way, especially obvious from the north side. The lake dries up more and more often, and it is with great attention and certain apprehension that the locals wait for the water to come back after the dry season. Many articles have been written about the lake and many songs have been sung, but to this day the words that would do justice to its beauty have not been found. For those who were growing up by the lake's shores, Imotski and Blue Lake are parts of the same existential paradigm. Spending summers by its waters, people have learned how to take responsibility: they protect the nature there or keep a wakeful eye on all children who cannot swim, even though they are not necessarily their own. Every lake-related experience is a good investment in the future. Children cannot learn anything wrong by its shores and when they grow up the lake brings them back to their childhood, refreshes them and renews them. Every summer we rediscover that same timeless beauty we left there the previous summer. The colour of the water varies from bluegreen to turquoise, depending on the water level and weather conditions. Chance travellers speak so nicely of the lake and those living in Imotski find it so natural that such a beauty befalls them by their very birthright. If you go for a swim over the shiny surface on a summer afternoon, look up towards the blue sky and all around you will see cliffs, rockslides, boulders, and protrusions convenient to jump from that only a divine force stops from swooping down. A ring of black pines on the horizon separates this water oasis in the middle of a boiling rocky ground from the outside world. The lake is so impressive that it is hard to articulate all the feelings that overwhelm you when you take your place on a rock and relax, your eyes erring with joy over the blue rippled water."
65,Imota,Vrljika river,"By all standards, the Vrljika is a unique karst river, which flows all the way through the Imotski Valley. It is impossible to include it into any standard classification because its hydrological and geological features are the same from the spring to the estuary. In other words, there is no upper, middle or lower flow. It is 23 kilometers long from the spring to the estuary and the whole of its course remains in a valley, just like the course of any other river in a plain. There are five wells at its spring, Jauk, Opačac, Utopišće, Duboka Draga and Dva Oka (or Jezerine), which is a unique phenomenon because the river starts flowing from two completely circular springs not a meter apart. Many legends and stories about the springs fill people with awe for water, which all of us are made of. The Vrljika changes its name along its course: it is called the Matica from Kamenmost on. Finally, the river sinks at the bottom of the valley and reappears in Bosnia and Herzegovina, known as the Tihaljina. The harvest in the Imotski Valley, as well as life itself, depends on the Vrljika. Not long ago the river water was potable throughout its course and endemic species like soft-muzzled trout, spotted minnow and whiteclawed crayfish were swimming in it. Unfortunately, man interfered with the life of the river, convinced that everything is allowed. The rich and fertile strength of the river slowly gives way to the new and cruel times. The area around the spring (and all the way down to the bridge on the river Perinuša) has been protected since 1971 as a special ichthyologic reserve. The river provides the whole Imotski region with fresh water. It is also known to be the habitat for some endemic species of fish, as well as for other fish, which is interesting for European ichthyologists. Although the surface of the reserve is small, the water is of high quality with an abundance of food for the fish. The Vrljika belongs to the Adriatic river basin, the home of 28 endemic species (as opposed to the Danube basin, where there are only two). Two endemic species in the Vrljika have not been studied in full detail yet: soft-muzzled trout (Salmothymus obtusirostris), studied by Krešimir Pažur, Ph.D. from the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb, and white-clawed crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes), whose population is monitored by Goran Klobučar, Ph.D. from the Faculty of Science in Zagreb. It is widely known that white-clawed crayfish and spotted minnow (gaovica) behave as if they were alive (i.e. as if they had just been caught) for several hours after being frozen and defrosted. Although the final conclusion about those endemic species has not been reached yet, the research has been slowed down due to a constant lack of means and protection. Formal and declarative protection has not ensured the survival of the above mentioned animals, so they are still on the list of highly endangered species. Žabarska Večer Unlike many places in the Imotski region where fishing nights have been organized in recent years, the locals of Zmijavci have gone a step further and organize every year manifestation Žabarska večer. Thus, more than a thousand guests from all over Croatia enjoy frog specialties, and the menu also includes eels and crabs. The heated atmosphere on an already hot night is mostly warmed by various tamburitza players, while draft beer and a nearby canal where the bravest jump in search of frogs that will bring them valuable prizes take care of the cooling. Definitely a successful folk party that is worth participating in."

Historians assume that this happened during the end of the 16th century."
75,Jezera,Tradition of folklore events,"The tradition of cultural gatherings of the inhabitants of Jezera are continued today by the folklore society KUD «Koledišće» which was founded in 1970. It was named after the old square of Jezera called Koledišće in the district Selo next to the former town hall (viknice) where the town representatives gathered on the island of Murter. The inhabitants of Jezera have been lighting koliadas, dancing at weddings, getting together at Koledišće for centuries. KUD «Koledišće» is a great example of long-term preservation of folk heritage which it propagates throughout the country and abroad, it has received numerous awards and recognitions thanks to generations of inhabitants of Jezera. In the cultural heritage of the people of Jezera, the unique «The Sailor Ball of Jezera» is particularly interesting, the custom of sending off a young seaman on his first voyage which delves into the distant past and is organized since 1911 when the League of sailors from Jezera was founded in Jezera."
75,Jezera,OGRICAS OF JEZERA,"Ogrica is special embroidery with multicoloured glass beads around the collar and down the front of women's lace blouses (opleća in the local dialect), made by the women of Jezera as a distinct detail of women's folk costume in Jezera and the neighbouring localities. It is thought that this decoration appeared in the 19th century when the embroidered multicoloured blouse (navezeno opleće) was replaced by white lace blouse (bilo opleće). The motifs embroidered with the glass beads were leaf, flower, cross, square, rectangle, circle, letters... Names of people and places were also embroidered. Female members of the Koledišće Folklore Society embroider ogricas on blouses even today as required for the society. Ogrica details are also embroidered in the form of bracelets or inside a wooden frame as souvenirs of Jezera."
75,Jezera,JEZERA BRIDAL WREATH,"Historical Jezera decoration on the heads of brides, worn by women from Jezera during weddings till the middle of the twentieth century. The wreaths are made today by Mrs. Anka Bilan in their original form or miniaturised as souvenirs. Examples of the wreath can be found in the Ethnography Museum in Zadar and in the Heritage Exhibition in the chapel of St John in Jezera. The wreath is made of wool and cotton thread, and silk ribbons (kurdelas and cendals in dialect)."
75,Jezera,SPARA OF JEZERA,"Spara is the round firm pad that the women of Jezera used to put on their heads when they were carrying weights on their heads (baskets, water containers), made of multicoloured fabric, connected and decorated with embroidery. Sparas are made today by Mrs. Anka Bilan and the female members of the Koledišće Folklore Society."
75,Jezera,History of Jezera,"Jezera, since the year 1602, has its own parish. In 1722, The Parish of Our Lady of Health was built with beautiful stone plates from the local quarries at the site of the old church. Next to the Church, on the east side, there is a bell tower that is 32m high. Which is also the oldest bell tower on the Island of Murter. The Church has a single nave with one main and two side chapels. There are seven altars and two balconies making it a nice example of Mediterranean Baroque. The main altar contains a bas-relief that stands out of Mary with baby Jesus plated in silver and gold. The altar of Our Lady of Seven Sorrows is particularly interesting and it is also considered to be one of the most beautiful wooden altars in all of Dalmatia. The Church Saint John of Trogir, in the cove, from the 17th century, houses the local heritage exhibition. The small Church of Saint Rocco, located in the field, is from the 16th century. The small Church of Saint Constance is located on the hill Kružak and was built in 1780 as a votive church of the patron of malaria, or the high fever that accompanied the disease. For the most part, local residents who were suffering from malaria built this Church. The Church was destroyed in World War II, however in 1994 it was rebuilt with the solidarity of people from Jezera. In the bay of Murter, which is still called Saint Nicholas, stands the Church Saint Nicholas from the 15th century, which was renovated in 2012. On May 10, 1911 the Society of Jezera seafarers was founded. On the memorial day of the founding and renewal of the Church Saint Nicholas (restored in 2011) decorated boats move towards the bay where a solemn mass is held along with a special program. The majority of files and last testaments, in respect to the town, come from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, and they were mainly written in Glagolitic, Bosnian Cyrillic and Latin. In particular, Glagolitic literacy was long developed and carefully cherished which was spoken about in the already mentioned book of Stošić: between 1750-1780, 11 priests died which were all natives of Jezera, as well as the mentioning of another 10 priests and friars from Jezera who served elsewhere. They were all Glagolitic and aided the establishment of the confraternity (brašćina).

We distinguish the topological characteristics of the three separate parts, which are today linked by modern construction. The youngest part of the settlement, the Sea, stretches along the coast of the bay. Of all the places on the island, Jezera was the first settlement that began building houses, during the mid - 18th century, right by the sea, most of them being summerhouses. By that time, there was already the danger of robbers from southern Italy, so the settlement was built in a compact matter about 400 m from the sea, which was evidenced by two of the older forms of settlements Selo (village) and Košuluk."
76,Josipdol,Josipdol,"Legend has it that Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Croatia, son of Maria Theresa, personally felt how badly Senj was connected to the hinterlands, falling off of his horse while crossing Kapela over today's Josipdol. This is why the locals named their town Josipdol (Josip is the Croatian version of the name Joseph). Maybe this, or the need for a better communication with the coast for military purposes, was why the construction of a road was carried out on the King's order and at his cost in 1775, led by engineering officer Vinko Struppi. Today this road is known as Via Josephina, i.e. the Josephina or Joseph's road. It connects Karlovac with Senj, central Croatia to the coast. Josipdol was previously called Munjava, and this name is today used for a large part of the municipality. Josipdol is located in the centre of Croatia - the Ogulin-Plaški-Modruš valley. It is surrounded by lush forests adorning the slopes of the Mala Kapela mountain. Although administratively it forms part of the Karlovac County, many consider it the northern-most town in Lika, and the heart of Croatia. Arheološko nalazište"

Its constructions is similar to the old Mikena buildings. Besides the funeral chambers (tholos), there is also an entrance hall (dromos). It is believed that this was the first solar observatory in Croatia because the dromos position is directed to the winter solstice."
78,Kanfanar,Kastelir,"Ever since the prehistorical times caves and semi-caves of Lim Valley have served as natural sanctuaries for the first hunters and gatherers, while the fruitful valley with numerous water springs made this area convenient for living. Kašteljir is a fort near Kanfanar with a sequence of smaller water springs nearby, as well as with the ruins of the St. Jacob the Apostle church and the church of st. Agatha. In the past, the location of Kašteljir was of interest because it was situated on the road of strategic importance, which led through the Lim Valley, from the sea (Lim Channel), towards the inland of Istria. The oldest archaeological finds -  some pieces of pots -  are the major proof that the area of Kašteljir used to be inhabited in the Roman times. According to the finds, life returned again in the end of the 9th century, when a Benedictine convent was founded nearby."

78,Kanfanar,Churches,"Parish Church of St. Sylvester The parish church of St. Sylvester is situated in the centre of Kanfanar village. It was built in 1696, at the very place where once stood a small church from the 13th century.  The church is a nave building with a side chapel and a sacristy, with its interior distinguished by many cultural, historical and religious values. Some of the church furniture was brought from Dvigrad, such as the stone pulpit from 13th century with a mixture of Romanesque and Gothic style, as well as one part of the baluster baptistery, which is situated at the entrance of the church. At the main altar, there is a picture of the Mother of Lord with a child, and of St. Silvester and St. Sofia. The side altar with a pale represents St. Anthony of Padua, and on the other side of the church there is a chapel with a large altar dedicated to the Lady of the Holy Rosary. The altar holds a statue of the Virgin. During the celebrations of Rosary, which is the greaatest feast of the parish, the statue is carried from the altar in solemn procession through the streets of Kanfanar. In 2012, the church was enriched with a copy of one of the most important relics in the Christian tradition - the Shroud of Turin. That same year the copy of the Shroud of Turin in its original size was donated to the parish of Kanfanar. There are only a few in the world, one of them being in Croatia. The Shroud of Turin (the Holy Turin) is considered the most important evidence of the resurrection of Jesus. It is the Shroud that holds, in a scientifically inexplicable way, a stamped photographic negative of a human body (the front and the back side), which was severely scourged, crowned with a crown of thorns, crucified and stabbed with a spear after death. All the previously conducted researches on the Turin supported the belief that it was the Turin in which Jesus Christ was wrapped after his death on the cross, and that the imprint of His body on the Turin appeared during the resurrection. Next to the church there is also a belfry dating from 1739."
78,Kanfanar,The Church of Saint Agatha,"Saint Agatha church, founded in the 10th century, is located on the road between Kanfanar and Vidulini. It is a single-nave building with polygonal apse, which is a typical Byzantine element. There is a visible fishbone pattern throughout apsid walls, which is typical of medieval architecture in Istria. Moreover, the church contains fresco paintings belonging to the Romanesque murals of Benedictine art dating from the Ottonian period. Apse frescoes are showing the salt of the Earth: Christ on the throne surrounded by angels, St. Agatha and St. Lucia, and the eleven apostles. A triumphal arch contains two victims: Abraham on the left and Cain on the right. It is assumed that they were painted by one of the painters who used to run Istrian painting workshops. In 1760 the church was erected and got new altar equipment, a Baroque altar painting and the antependium. Virgin Mary of the Snow Church in Maružini This church is believed to be dating from the 12th century. It is dedicated to the Virgin Mary of Snow, and is located at the old road near Maružini village. The church is a nave building with a bell tower. The altar painting shows the Virgin with the Child surrounded by two martyrs. One of them holds a chalice and wafer in his hand, as a symbol of priests, and the other holds forceps and tooth, so it is assumed that it could be St. Apollonia. The stone used for building the church is decorated with wicker, which is typical of the 8th and 9th century. Therefore, it is believed that it was built from the remains of some nearby church."
78,Kanfanar,Saint Valentine Church,"The votive church of St. Valentine was built in 18th century by a canon Bartolomeus Francaz (according to the quote written on the panel to the right of the entrance): ""Amazing grace he received from God upon the glory of St. Valentine whom he honoured."" The church was built opposite the canon's house and has the odour of sanctity. The upper part of the altar shows the Virgin and the Child, and the lower St. Valentine and St. Apollonia. The wooden statue stands to the right of the altar and the church also contains reliquary with the powers of St. Valentine."

78,Kanfanar,Dvigrad,"There are countless ruins of towers, castles and forts, but there is only one Dvigrad - it hadn't been torn down neither by a military force, nor by the fire, yet, it was abandoned and left in his own doom. It stands as a reminder to passengers and an acquisition to visitors of how an old Istrian medieval town was built back then."
78,Kanfanar,HISTORY,"The ruins of the medieval town Dvigrad are the most important and best-known cultural heritage of the Kanfanar municipality. The name ˝Dvigrad˝ (Duo Castra, Due Castelli, Dvegrad) indicates the existence of two parts of the town (Moncastel and Parentin) that have been mentioned since 9th and 10th century as a unique town. The mutual name remained even after the collapse of the castle Parentin, when only Moncastel remained. Thanks to its remarkable strategic location near water and plenty of fertile ground, that area had been inhabited since the prehistoric period, and by the end of 6th century the first Slavic communities started to settle there. The land seemed neglected, since the government had not been organized yet. At that time the land was cultivated by the Benedictines, who left their traces in the Lim area in the early medieval period. In historical literature Dvigrad was mentioned for the first time in the year 879, when its church fell under the jurisdiction of Akvilanian patriarch instead of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pula. By the end of 13th century the Gothic counts took the possession of Dvigrad, when its ethnical structure gradually started to change, dominated by the Slavic nation despite the bigger immigration of German population. Constant battles and confrontations marked the upcoming era in Dvigrad. In 1381 Venetians burnt the town and slaughtered its people, and they transferred the power from the basilica of St. Sofia to St. Lorenzo del Pasenatico (St. Lovreč Pazenatički). Venetians took authority over Dvigrad in 1413, when they established the Statute of the Dvigrad commune and annulled the patriarchs rule. Under their authority Dvigrad progressed, but at the end of 15th century the area was stricken by plague, which was soon followed by the malaria. At the beginning of the 16th century Dvigrad was inhabited by refugees from Dalmatian hinterland and Herzegovina, who were running from the Ottomans. The Uskok war started between Venice and Austria whereupon all surrounding villages were destroyed. The people of Dvigrad started to inhabit those surrounding areas. Around 1630 the town was almost completely abandoned and only very poor families remained there. In 1714 the Dvigrad parish was moved near Kanfanar and this marked the end of Dvigrad."
78,Kanfanar,A WALK THROUGH DVIGRAD,"Dvigrad is situated in Limska Draga, in a deep valley spreading from Limska Draga Fjord to Pazin. The settlement is located at an altitude between 150 and 175 metres above the sea level. Today it is possible for visitors to see the ruins of Moncastel (Parentin castle, the other part of Dvigrad, was destroyed to the ground and a plateau is all that remains). The part of the town protected by the first fortification belt is reached through the existing town gate. The other gate, built in the second fortification ring, stands further down the path. That is how the town was entered: door-to-door. Along the big watchtower on the town's south side, the path leads to the third and final gate, behind which the town centre lies. The town is enclosed with double defence walls within which more than 200 buildings have been preserved. The central part of the settlement is dominated by St. Sofia church built in several phases. During the oldest, early Christian phase (the second half of 5th century), the church was a single-nave building with a semi-circular apse. The chancel was upgraded over time into having three semi-circular apses and frescoes. During 9th and 10th century a chapel (baptistery) and a bell tower were annexed to the south side, while in 14th century a sacristy was added to the north side. A hexagonal embossed pulpit from the same period was relocated after Dvigrad's collapse to the Kanfanar's parish church, where it can be seen today. Among the reliefs adorning the pulpit, the outstanding one is that of St. Sofia, holding a town in each hand. It's a symbol of Dvigrad and a motif on Kanfanar's coat of arms. The most significant buildings in Dvigrad located near the town square are the town palace at the east end and bishop chapel premises at the west end. A line of military garrison facilities is to the west of the basilica. The south-west part of the town used to be an artisan zone, while other parts used to be residential."
78,Kanfanar,THE LEGEND OF THE MONSTRANCE,"When Dvigrad was visited during canonical visitations of bishop Tomassini of Novigrad in 1650, it was populated by three families only, and the poorest ones, too. Even the priests had left Dvigrad, only to return daily for the holy mass. Since it was difficult for them to return   each day, they decided to move the holy altar sacrament and consecrated hosts from Dvigrad to Kanfanar. Upon their arrival to the church on the following morning, the monstrance with the Holy body was no longer there. They went on a search for the monstrance, finding it shining in the woods at the foot of Dvigrad. When a priest tried to take the monstrance, it started getting away, but stopped after he put on his chasuble. Thus he managed to bring it into the church, whereupon bishop Vaira officially moved the parish centre from Dvigrad to Kanfanar. THE LEGEND OF HENRY MORGAN'S TREASURE Henry Morgan was a notorious pirate who fought the Spanish under command of the governor of Jamaica, Thomas Modyford. His accomplishments often exceeded his jurisdiction, the greatest by far being the conquest of Panama. However, looting in Panama broke a peace treaty between Spain and England so Morgan provoked the rage of the British, who began to pursue him. According to the legend, while trying to escape from the English fleet, he was chased deep into the Adriatic Sea, and finally arrived to Limska Draga Fjord. Its meandering ways and furtiveness made an ideal hiding place for both him and his treasure. Upon anchoring ashore the Fjord, he also discovered Dvigrad, which was almost completely abandoned by that time. Therefore he decided to hide his treasure there. Henry Morgan found his new home near Dvigrad, in a village now known under the name of M(o)rgani."
78,Kanfanar,Dvigrad festival,"Numerous festivals and happenings in Istria use medieval remains of Istrian fortresses and citadels as a stage, but there is only one music festival in Dvigrad which uses the whole medieval town as its stage. The streets of Dvigrad will take visitors to the magnificent Basilica of Saint Sofia, the city patron, where the musical journey through the history begins. Many concerts during Dvigrad Festival are held by the top domestic and foreign musicians, who take their listeners back to the early era of sacral music and tell them the story of how people lived back then, how they entertained themselves and celebrated with music."

78,Kanfanar,Fusi,"A story of the most famous pasta in Istria, the fusi, began during 20th century when grandma Luca from Kanfanar accidentally shaped the fusi while trying to surprise a dear guest with a special meal. As she was making the pasutice, which is another type of traditional Istrian pasta, she came up with an idea to shape the dough in a new and special way.  And so, the queen of Istrian pasta was born. Ever since, this pasta has been prepared in Istria for special occasions and celebrations and it is one of the gastronomic specialties everyone who visits Istria should try. Apart from being a municipality represented by the Istrian ox and the fusi, Kanfanar is also proud to be a home of the artisanal handicraft „Klara Marić"", which was founded in 1987 and has been making top quality pasta since, with a special emphasis on traditional Istrian pasta.

78,Kanfanar,Jakovlja,"Since ancient times this area has had cattle fairs right beside the ruins of what used to be a convent dedicated to this saint - St Jacob. In the early nineties of 20th century the tradition came to life again with the Istrian ox exhibition as the central event. These were the years when very few of the Istrian boscarinos were left and the entire breed was at the brink of extinctions. Keeping in mind the goal of raising awareness about the issue of Istra being this close to completely losing its utmost symbol, the citizens of Kanfanar came to an idea of the oxen show, with an addition of holding elections for the most beautiful,  the heaviest and the most obedient Istrian ox. In the following years, greatly thanks to Jakovlja, the number of oxen had increased, yet the breed never ceased to be endangered. Today, the Kanfanar ox show is attended by proud boscarino owners with sometimes weighing over a ton. After the opening ceremony, the parade goes to the public scale where the heaviest boscarinos are selected, followed by a spectacle of the old fashioned ploughing procedure with oxen. Visitors are welcomed to try this interesting skill. After proclaiming the heaviest, the most obedient and the most  good-looking of Istrian oxen, there is a night-long celebration with a rich art, cultural and entertainment programme. Nowadays, Jakovlja is also enriched with various other programmes, such as the Fridays' gastro show Fuzijada, where visitors can learn how to make and cook this most famous of all pastas in Istria. That is, of course, the opportunity to try ""fusi"", a kind of home-made pasta, with various sauces.

If you are looking for unforgettable experiences in gastronomy, tradition, culture and history  - welcome to Jakovlja!"
78,Kanfanar,Lim Bay,"The Lim bay is one of the most beautiful places in Istra, legally protected as a significant landscape and a specific marine reserve. It is a sunken karst valley with specific vegetation and marine landmarks. It was developed in limestones, with approx. 10 km length, 600 m average width and canyon sides up to 150 m height. The sides of the bay are overgrown with all characteristics of holm oak (Quercus ilex L.), mock privet (Phillyrea latifolia L.), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.), laurustinus (Viburnum tinus L.), Mediterranean smilax (Smilax aspera L.), mastic (Pistacia lentiscus L.), oriental horn beam (Carpinus orientalis Mill.), manna ash (Fraxinus ornus L.). The microclimate conditions the growth of submediterranean community of downy oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) A diversity of vegetation in such narrow area represents the unique ecological rarity. Specific properties of the sea cause and condition the richness of flora and fauna with exceptional communities that cohabitate on the sea bottom. Due to its many underwater springs, the sea water is of decreased salinity, which varies depending on the time of the year and the depth. The sea is of less transparency, indicating an abundance of planktons. There are noticeable changes in temperature as well as high oxygen concentration. Such specific properties determine richness of flora and fauna of the sea with exceptional communities of the sea bottom. The area is a natural breeding spot for certain species of fish. There is a well- known mussel and oyster farm, which can be tasted at some of the restaurants nearby."
78,Kanfanar,Lim bay as a movie set,"In the mid-twentieth century the Lim bay was a suitable film set for shooting films about Vikings. In 1958 a film called Viking was shot there, with Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis in leading roles. Even a small Viking settlement was made there; it also appeared in another film called Long Ships ten years later, in 1968. The Lim Bay was presented as a fiord, this is why it is sometimes called Lim Fjord!"
78,Kanfanar,Olive oil festival,"Kanfanar and its surrounding area was always known as an ideal location for growing olives and producing quality olive oil.

78,Kanfanar,Sing the Istrian songs,"One of the most valuable things of Istrian cultural heritage is a specific folk song singing style, so-called ""singing at thin and thick"". As such, the two part narrow intervals of Istrian and Croatian coast are included in the UNESCO representative list of intangible cultural heritage, which has become one of the 13 intangible Croatian assets protected by this organisation. In order to preserve the traditional Istrian folk singing, people can visit the manifestation ""Sing the Traditional Istrian songs"" in September in Barat, where this specific and unique type of folk singing is heard. The authentic Istria has been created from generation to generation, with family gatherings around a fire place. To experience this, one should come and see the Kantadurs of Barat, where singing verses were taught by grandparents underneath the open sky, at the bottom of the Saint Peter in Chains church."

80,Karlovac,The Foginovo beach,"Karlovac, the town on four rivers, boasts the first registered river beach in Croatia. It is situated on the Korana bank. The Foginovo beach, as the historic heritage of the citizens, has been engraved in the town''s very fabric, and its future matrix, just like a genetic code. Even a century later, it remains a memorable place. From its source at the Plitvice lakes, all the way to its mouth, where it joins the Kupa river in Karlovac, the green beauty that is the Korana river adorns its surroundings. As it flows practically through the very centre of the town, both the citizens and the visitors have been using it, for centuries and throughout the year, as an oasis of peace and the place to get in touch with the nature. From the time is health benefits river, while it beckoned them to swim and relax during the summer heat. Today, this river beach is where it was a long time ago and people still go there like they always did. The same historic picture is still very alive. Like some kind of a magic magnet, the Korana attracts visitors, locals, those in love, the sad, the children and grandmother alike, the adventure lovers and those seeking serenity. The Cener („Ten""), the top board of the 10m high diving tower, is reserved for the bravest divers, there's also a 5m diving board, for the less courageous, and also the 3m board, for those who want to get into the water as quickly as possible. The less experienced swimmers can fing refreshment in the shallower part of the river, and for those with limited moving capabilities, there's a water lift, a number of special deck chairs, the changing stalls, as well as toilets. There are lifeguards watching over the beach, and the activity directors busy both in the water and on the grass, while a free water park will bring smiles to the faces of all those yearning for unusual ways of getting into the water. If you cannot decide whether to choose water polo of beach volleyball, go to the shade of the riverside cafe and let the breeze in your hair and the ice in your glass solve the dilemma for you. If you like morning, this beach offers the privilege to swim alongside the swans, and if you prefer evenings and nights, opt for the summer joys of the open-air river cinema. Or play tennis at the nearby courts. Or visit the freshwater aquarium, the Aquatika, and dive into the world of the fish and the underwater river life. If you feel like running, use the nearby track, if you feel like stretching and training, use the outdoor gym, and if you want to keep your mental fitness, read a book. In case you just want some peace and quiet, just sit on the Korana bank, in the shade of a century old willows, and watch the river in silence. If you're lucky, for a moment, you might even hear the unusual sounds of the Karlovac mermaids' song."
80,Karlovac,Aquatika - freshwater aquarium Karlovac,"Aquatika - freshwater aquarium Karlovac. Dive under the surface - there are more than 100 freshwater fish! Have you ever been to a freshwater aquarium? Have you ever seen a catfish sleeping? Do you know what the life span of verious fish is? Which one is the fastest, which one the slowest?

For all the answers go to the Aquatika - the Karlovac freshwater aquarium! The aquarium presents the flora and fauna of the Croatian rivers, lakes and ponds, its geological past, traditional culture, as well as the history of the four Karlovac rivers area - the vasins of the Korana, Kupa, Mrežnica and Dobra.

Visitors can thus experience the whole river course, from its source, to its mouth. The Aquatika, this unusual building perfectly blended into the Korana surroundings, has won several prestigious awards for architecture and sustainable development while preserving the nature. If you cannot really see it at first, it just means that it deserves all its awards. But you'll find it eventually, don't worry. It will beckon you with its magical attraction. And if you do not belive in magic, here are the coordinates: 45°29'7' N, 15°33'44' E. There, it was not so difficult after all, was it? You have found it. Enter.

You'll have a feeling you're walking along a river, scuba-diving in it and disappearing with a subterranean course, going deep into the dark labyrinth of caves. You'll be surprised by the richness of biodiversity of the water world, inspiring your new passion and wish to get back to nature."
80,Karlovac,Karlovac parks,"From the ancient times of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the philosophy of landscaping symbols tends towards attaining the spiritual peace of a divine garden. The Latin word parricus (from which the English word park originated) denotes an enclosure or a ''defended space''. Do parks defend us from the alienated world of urban bustle? Is Karlovac a town with therapeutic parks or is it all one huge park with a town within? It seems that the historian R. Radovinović''s words ''a town within a park'' are best suited to describe the dominant impression of Karlovac. The green vistas of the town are awaiting, regardless of the direction of your approach. And one of the approaches is the majestic Marmont Alee, where you'll feel welcome in the embrace of the centuries old giant plane trees, or feel obliged to stop and have a break after seeing the playful red leaves of the maples. Your stress is probably going to be at risk, likely to disappear in all the greenery. We are not going to charge you for that. The first parks in Karlovac were planned already during the construcion of the fort itself. And that is how it all got started. We haven't stopped doing this even to this very day, taking care of our parks, avenues, flowers and lawns. Our parks grow with the town. The town is a part of the park. We have flowers at our windows. Our river beaches are covered in lush and soft grass. Take a walk around the town developed within a park. Your footsteps will be welcome by the Grand Promenade (Šetalište dr. Franje Tuđmana), with a five-fold alee, a flowering magnolia next to the 'Small Gloriette', the park vegetation in the moats, the Renaissance park next to the Polytechnic, the linden alee near the town walls remnants, the Black Promenade, the Arboretum around the Forestry School, the Modrušan Park with a playground near the Edison cinema, the Vrbanić Gardens along the Korana river... or a small hidden park within the Franciscan monastery. Turn on all the five senses, as well as the sixth, the hidden one. Listen to the birds early in spring, or to the pine cones crackling in the summer heat. Feel the prickling of the winter frost and the smell of the flowering linden. Look at all the greenery! In winter, when the coldness takes away the freenery from the park and freezes the time, our parks are the pulsating heart of this town. Let you own heartbeats join this green rhythm."
80,Karlovac,The four rivers,"Karlovac is situated on the banks of four rivers. It is only logical, then, that it is also a town of many bridges. Further analysis brings us to the conclusion that it is a town of boats. Also of fog, angling, fish, frogs and an odd mosquito. Everything in this town is connected to the four rivers, the freshwater Aquatika aquarium, the romantic walks along the banks and the drinking water. We use them to name everything we can, from kindergartens, to sports clubs, to restaurants, to our own children. For reasons unbeknownst to us, Mother Nature decided to locate all the spare rivers right here. For reasons that are quite well-known, however, a wise man decided to build a town on the banks of those four rivers. And here we are, in the watery embrace of our own four beauties. How many times have we mentioned the word 'four'? Four times. Every Karlovac citizen has his or her own favourite river. And each river has its special hue. Every visitor is going to fall in love with one of the rivers. Or with all of them? All four. Did you know that in Karlovac you can swim in all of the four rivers in a single day? If you're in a hurry and cannot stay the whole day, we can show you how and where, in just two dives, you can swim in all four. Two in four. The Kupa river is the longest of the four, with its spring in the Risnjak national park. All the other Karlovac rivers eventually flow into the Kupa. Sometimes it is very unpredictable, but mostly it is quiet and serene, dangerous only when agitated. At those times it washes over out streets and keeps us busy at the levees. The only mystery: why the river whose spring is only 30km from the Adriatic Sea flows in the very opposite direction, like no other river in the world? The Korana river is unique as we cannot take you to its spring. It nas no spring. It flows out of the Plitvice Lakes, through a canyon with many waterfalls and cascades and becomes tranquil in Karlovac. Just like the Kupa, it flows almost through the very town-centre. Thanks to the unusual combination of the dissolved minerals, its waters are conductive to health, and so it used to have a spa. It is the most popular river when it comes to swimming and other summer joys with its Foginovo beach. The Mrežnica river has two springs, in contrast to the Korana, which has none. Strange rivers, no doubt about it. The Mrežnica is famous for its tufa barriers and cascades. We did our best to count them and got the precise result: there's an endless number of them. The best way to get to know the river is in a kayak. The Dobra river has one spring and also two additional springs. And several different names in its upper parts. In Ogulin, it turns into a subterranean river at Đula''s Abyss. After that, it resurfaces, rushing through a canyon, over the dams, filling reservoirs, powering the old mills and in the end slowly flows into the Kupa."
80,Karlovac,The grain boat,"Historically, Karlovac was a boating town. Even to this day, the houses along the Kupa have paths leading to the very bank, the wooden boats are a common sight, while rowing is a popular sport even among children. Boat building used to be a common trade, challenging us to try and build a traditional Kupa boat. We have accepted the challenge and today you can board the grain boat ''Zora'', a replica of the boats that used to ply the Kupa river in the 18th century. This unique European attraction is going to take you back in time, show you how grain was transported by boats, along the Kupa and the Sava rivers. That was also how Karlovac was connected to the rest of Croatia, but also to the Danube and the distant Timişoara. This tumbas is one of the three types of river boats of the Karlovac boatmen's guild, the most prosperous town fuild of the Illyrian movement period. Today, the 'Zora' dock is in the Brođani village, some 15km from Karlovac. The boat will take you through different ages and show you the value of the ancient oak it was built from. The ride lasts an hour and a half, complete with tasting of the home-made flavoured liqueurs and traditional home-made cookies. Out boatmen will entertain you with the stories of the boat, of the area's history, of sunken boats, and the rich flora and fauna. Visitors can enjoy the ride accompanied by traditional music, buy the traditional products, drinks, jams or unique souvenirs. They will also see the remnants of the old railway bridge destroyed during the Croatian War of Independence, the Pauline monastery and the church of St. Mary of the Snows in Kamensko. Just like with all the boats and ships in the world, this one also often has company: gulls. But chatty wild geese, playful otters or reticent, busy beavers are also a common sight. The bravest passengers can try their hand at the helm, with the skipper's help, while the youngest ones can keep watch beside the boat's bell, in case a lone angler in his little boat gets in the way."
80,Karlovac,Karlovac - four seasons on the four rivers,"It may be true that all roads lead to Rome, but all roads also go through Karlovac. And this is the right place for you to stop the time and discover the life of the town on the four rivers during all four seasons. We have always loved it and it is for you to fall in love with the freshly blossomed colours of the Karlovac springtime, the summer blue-green colours of the rivers, the autumn rustle of all those browns in the parks and the crystal white of the silent winters. At any time of the year, Karlovac's doors are open to you, revealing unique locations, where the experiences turn into memories lasting for a long time even after you have returned home. And while you're here, why don't you stay a bit longer? We offer a whole palette of events, so paint your own picture of memories from the four seasons on the four rivers. This is the time to arrive with your camera and make a photo-wallpaper for your home: the autumn colours are going to keep you warm long into the winter, too. Karlovac autumns are a collage of mottled treetops in the old allies and mystical foggy vistas. And it smells of roasted chestnuts. In case you still haven't discovered the Karlovac autumns, this is the perfect time to prepare the stores of memories for winter. The winters in Karlovac are magical! Frozen poplar branches along the Korana make for a picture that'll freeze your breath. Swans that came for the winter turn the river into a swan lake. The parks don a white dress and embrace you like your grandmother offering hot tea for your frozen fingers. The enchanting and silent scenes can turn into fun and laughter in no time, the sleds fly along the Šanac slopes, while the skates dance to the music, the mottled lights of the Karlovac Advent invite you to join your friends, and the night clubs offer various attractions for long winter nights. New Year's Eve in Karlovac! Oh, yes! Welcome the new year under the lucky star of the historic Karlovac Star! After the carnival season has dispelled the icy winter specters, spring starts to rule the town. And it is no ordinary spring, the way spring tends to be elsewhere. The Karlovac springs are a pure joy of life! It is time to wake all your senses and it is for you to decide whether you would like to enjoy the colours of flowerbeds, the soft grass in the park during the Springtime Promenades or in the sounds of guitars over a barbecue on the Korana banks. If you have already experienced Karlovac in spring, we know we'll meet again. If nor, indulge in a bit of selfish luxury - this is a town perfect for recovering after all the stress of the bustling modern world. And if you like the hustle and bustle, sign up for the Karlovac Cener run, a nightly race around the historic Star in late spring... and beat the time! Karlovac summers smell of blue and green, with a whiff of the ancient stone facades. The summer events mosaic is called the Summer under the Stars, full of song and dance as it only befits summers. The Karlovac summer begins with the St John's Eve bonfires and ends with a real desert: the Strudel Week. Take your smile on a walk through the town and enjoy the theatre performances, the traditional dances, music and swimming in the rivers. Also, make sure you visit the Beer Days or otherwise your visit to Karlovac my not count at all."
80,Karlovac,The Church of the Holy Trinity and the Franciscan monastery,"With its Baroque belfry, the Holy Trinity Church stands in the centre of the Star, the Karlovac old town, as a landmark, a beacon, both in the actual space and on one''s spiritual journey. It was built at the same time as the fort itself, with various parts added through the centuries, and is the very heart of the town''s spiritual life. It is also a part of the town''s religious heritage, and an unavoidable point for meeting history, people and one''s own self. The Franciscan monastery and the church are a part of the same complex, and since the 17th century the Franciscans have been taking care of it. Having arrived to Karlovac, the Franciscans started to run the local schools and to teach reading, writing, arithmetic and religious education. They also studied the Karlovac flora and wrote natural history and geography textbooks. Through the centuries, they have accumulated an impressive collection consisting of ten thousand rare books and religious objects, which can be seen at the monastery museum. The Holy Trinity Church is a nationally recognised cultural monument. It is connected to the monastery and has an impeccable walled garden. If you're lucky, you might take a peek into the walled courtyard and taste the Franciscan craft beer in this quiet heaven, away from the everyday hustle and bustle. The Franciscans keep invaluable treasures, not only rare works of art, stained glass and unique altarpieces, but they also protect the town's cultural and spiritual identity. All the tourist guides and brochures list the religious heritage among the to 10 'must see' locations. Karlovac is no exception in that regard. Centuries of Franciscan activity and cultural endeavours in the town's old centre have turned this complex into a memorial and a real cultural heritage treasury. You just have to visit it."
80,Karlovac,The Dubovac Castle,"Old records show there has always been a fort on top of the hill overlooking the Kupa river. Even before there were written records to speak of. We do not really know when we built the Dubovac Castle, we do not remember it all that well. We finished the construciton in the 13th century, since we were under constant attacks and had to defend our grain and salt traders, as well as the Kupa boatmen. From the main tower, one can see the Kupa river and beyond, check it out for yourself. The Dubovac Castle is one of the best preserved and most beutiful monuments of medieval architecture in Croatia. It was built on a prehistoric hill above the Kupa, and was named after the dubs, the oaks growing on the surrounding slopes. It changed hands many times throughout history, changing its appearance according to the needs and fashion of the period. Its current appearance is the result of a comprehensive restoration program carried out during the mid-twentieth century. The collective memory of Karlovac citizens says that the castle water well hides a tunnel leading to the Kupa bank and the Old Town. We sould love to ascertain the information, but are afraid it might only be a legend, and that would be an unpleasant blow. So let it be the way it is now. We all love legends and fairy-tales. The enchanted castle courtyard is going to stay enchanted regardless of the historical evidence. Enjoy the medieval atmosphere of the restaurant inside the castle, visit the museum inside the tower, and while climbing the squeaky wooden steps, feel like you're a part of Karlovac, a part of Dubovac! The walls are cold, but they still hide a host of warm stories of the Zrinski family love, the Frankopan family successes and the diverse fates of the people closely connected to the castle. And while there, do stay until the sunset. You'll see Karlovac bathed in the evening colours, changing its face in front of you, practically in the palm of your hand."
80,Karlovac,Getting around Karlovac,"Karlovac loves its visitors. This has been a part of our genetic code. For centuries, this has been the place of encounters, the meeting point of people, rivers and roads. We have built roads for you to be able to come here. Doesn't it show how welcome you are? Had we not wanted you here, we would not have built the roads, we would have built walls instead. OK, now that it is out of the way, you can relax and enjoy getting around the town. How to reach Karlovac? The Earth is round, so, whichever direction you choose, you'll get to Karlovac. The longest journey would be from New Zealand, so we suggest you take the shortcut, through the Earth's very core. It used to be easier to reach us from other parts of the world when all the current continents were still a part of one supercontinent. In the meantime, we got the airplanes, though, so that's no longer a problem, either. The closest airport is near Zagreb, and from Zagreb you can take a train, a bus, a rented car or a taxi. We'll leave other options to your creativity. Having arrived to Karlovac, your best mode of transportation will be your legs and feet, as pedestrians rule supreme in this town. Just step on a zebra crossing and you'll see just how mighty you really are! All the drivers are going to stop and let you cross the road even before you have made that decision. The locals' favourite transportation is a bicycle. You can rent it at the Nextbike docks or from private renters. Bikes have been so important historically that we have even written our own rules for their use in the streets. Today, some of them are outdated, for instance the rule regarding the overtaking of riders, so we introduced the road signs and bike lanes. The oldest bicycle, a velocipede, is exhibited in the Town Museum. It is used for photographic purposes only. We also have a plan for a tram network from 1905, but due to the bureaucratic obstacles, we still have no trams. But there are buses. And taxis. Sometimes you'll even see an open carriage pulled by a team of Lipizzan horses, so you can feel like royalty while sightseeing this free royal city. If you prefer smaller wheels, a skateboard or roller skates are an excellent choice, and if you do not like the wheels at all, get into a small river boat or into a larger grain boat and sail away. And if you suffer from hydrophobia, sail in your mind, while sitting on a park bench, looking at the church tower clock. These mental journeys are always offered free of charge."
80,Karlovac,Karlovac through the six senses,"Karlovac is the town on four rivers, the town of encounters, the meeting place, the town of parks. It is the town in which you can swim in four rivers in a single day and accidentally meet old friends as all the roads go through Karlovac, or you can have a cup of coffee in the peace and green shade of its many parks. Today, the relentless race for the title of the best tourist destination means that a huge and merciless battle for tourist points is always on. Each individual is important, each overnight stay, the visitors' spending, too, the destination rebranding is also important, while the marketing and PR agencies get more and more professional, specialising in ever more imaginative tourist campaigns. In this lively parchwork of photos and advertisements, we sometimes forget that the ideal place for a tourist visit is the one where you are, whether these are the colourful streets of the world major cities, a small farm on the eastern coast of a tropical archipelago, or simply Karlovac. Wherever you are, you'll also find what you're looking for. Just like all the other towns and cities in the world, Karlovac is unique. Its little things and details hide both its past and its future. And if you look closely, you'll discover its unusual story, veiled in the blue and green cloak of this moment. It'll be a unique and special love. You like and need numbers? Enter the historic centre of Karlovac, built in the shape of a six-pointed star, and let the five centuries flow through you, from the ancient swamp, to the cold walls of the Renaissance fortress, to the merry sounds of today's clubs and cafes. Read between the lines at the Promenade, a unique pearl of the town's landscaping heritage. Allow yourself to make the time stop and turn the numbers upside down. In summer, swim in all the four rivers in one day, just in two places. Impossible? Feel all the dimensions of Karlovac's 3D parks. Count your steps in going around the star-shaped fort. Did you really need the 4321 steps? And while you're at it, count the rivers, too, just to be on the safe side... You never know. As a town, Karlovac developed from the fort, the six-pointed Star, and should be fully enjoyed through all the six senses. Your sight will be best activated from the Dubovac Castle, from where it can sail down the Kupa river, wander the parks, and dive deep among the historic facts. Your hearing will let you hear the silence of the streets at night, as well as the guitar sounds along the Korana banks. The nose i going to feel the freshness of a foggy daybreak, the smells of flowering lindens and the warm scents from the bakeries. Touch has mostly been neglected in the tourist offer, though it is so important: feel the heeling Korana waters, feel the tickling of the grass on your bare feet, the touch of the cold beer glass and the coldness of stone in the Karlovac fort. Also the precious hug by old friends in this town of encounters. The taste of ice-cream during the summer heat, the taste of sweet and salty home-made specialties or, simply, the taste of cold and clear water from a well. And if something's still missing or you just want to boost your experience, turn on the sixth sense, too, that 'something', recognise the Karlovac X-factor in the feeling of being welcome here. The town of this story has a very unique relationship with each of us, whether we were born in it, whether we're just passing through. For even the smallest footprint in its soil is going to be indelible, both for Karlovac and for all those that have ever been in it. So make it a print with a smile. Why visit Karlovac? Or simply decide: we're going to Karlovac. Of all the decisions in your life, this one could bi a winner. Just be careful, you might like it. We offer a break from stress and it is up to you to decide if you want to meditate during daybreak at the Korana banks or dance at the central square, celebrating the town's birthday, sneak around the Dubovac Castle walls, explore the hidden courtyards of the historic old town, breath in the silence and stillness of the Holy Trinity church, check out the fish in the freshwater aquarium Aquatika, laugh at the comic play at the Zorin dom theatre, hang out at the colourful night clubs, explore the history at the Town Museum, surprise your palate in one of the various restaurants, go bird-watching at the Vrbanić gardens, or check out whether there really are some mermaids hiding in the Korana or Kupa. If you have decided to spend a day in Karlovac, you'll soon realize a day is very short and it's already night. Embrace the night, during the night the town is very quiet and there are stars above its Star. Enjoy the daybreak on a riverbank, among the misty smells, bathing in the warmth of the rising sun. Karlovac has never been conquered during its history. But you can conquer it - with a smile! Make a mosaic out of your memories of the Renaissance architecture, the green parks, the clear rivers and the time you spent with the locals. You cannot lose in this battle, though there's always a possibility of Karlovac conquering you. Karlovac is the town of three-dimensional parks, of four rivers, of five centuries and six-pointed Star. Having experienced all that, you'll be in seventh heaven... in cloud nine...! and you deserve it."
80,Karlovac,Saint Nicholas church,"The Josip ban Jelačić Square flanked by two church towers is a familiar postcard sight. St. Nicholas church at the central square of the Old Town, along with the Church of the Holy Trinity, is a well-known town vista, too. It is the only Orthodox church in Karlovac. Its patron saint, St. Nicholas, is the patron of sailors, but also of river sailing, so that at the time of the historical economic boom, it was a logical neme choice, connecting the rivers and the seas, emphasizing the links of Karlovac and the sea trading routes. The Renaissance square court of the military complex has been turned into an elegant central square of the free royal city, surrounded by military and religious buildings. Both the citizens and the Town Council wanted the square to be a 'town adornment'. And so it became a lively town centre, surrounded by churches and military buildings, busy and noisy thanks to the open-air farmers' market. Apart from its Baroque belfry you'll see the moment you enter the square, this church has a carved wooden iconostasis with 74 icons, a choir, a pulpit and the pews. Contributing to the formal and solemn atmosphere is an array of wooden icons. At the beginning of the Croatian War of Independence, the church was marked by the Hague Convention protective blue shield, most of the inventory was put in a safe place, but the church still sustained major damage. After the war, a new church was built on the site, mimicking the old one, so today you can enjoy the new look of this part of the religious heritage of Karlovac."
80,Karlovac,The Town Museum,"The latest international studies show that regular museum-goers, enjoying the arts and new insights, get even more from those experiences - they''re happier and less lonely than others, less prone to depression and anxiety. Museums are, therefore, important for your health. As a historic town, Karlovac loves history. History is life's teacher. In Karlovac, it lives in the star-shaped walls of the fort, but also in the Town Museum. The museum is situated in the oldest Karlovac mansion, at the Strossmayer Squaer, a former Frankopan residence (the so-called kurija). It was founded at the very beginning of the 20th century, as a place to preserve the town's memories and antiques. The collection comprises seven departments. This magic number is going to open up the images of historic events and customs for you, in a different way. The museum takes care of the collections and exhibition spaces in four more locations, the Vjekoslav Karas Gallery, the Branič Tower at the Dubovac Castle, the Ribar family house in Vukmanić and the Homeland War Museum in Turanj. The permanent exhibition of the archaeological department offers the evidence of human activity in the Karlovac area, the historical department holds many objects, documents and photographs, the cultural one presents interesting artefacts, from household objects to industrial heritage, the ethnographical department houses the rural heritage and the brothers Seljan collection, the gallery has a rich collection of paintings, graphics and sculptures by Karlovac artists, the natural history department testifies to the evolution of nature, while the contemporary history department is the latest addition to the museum, taking care of the Homeland War collection. The Vučjak traditional house As its name suggests, the Vučjak traditional house is located in Vučjak, a colourful village on a hill overlooking Karlovac. Apart from preserving the traditional songs, dances and customs, members of the ''Sv. Ana - Vučjak'' folklore society have collected hundreds of traditional artifacts and objects, tools, textiles and other parts of village life in Vučjak at the turn of the 20th century. Observing their motto, 'Our things of old are out greatest treasure, given to us not to be wasted and thrown away, but to be held dearly and with pride', they formed a collection comprising various clay objects and wooden dishes, woodworking tools, agricultural tools, looms and other weaving implements, various chests, beds, cribs, tables, benches, baskets and a number of handicrafts such as traditional costumes, linens and towels. Each object has some etnographic and educational value and the collection, as a whole, presents the way of life, dressing, the community economics and the locals' skills. This traditional house is an ideal place to learn something new about this part of history and those who perpetuated that history through the centuries."
80,Karlovac,The Zorin dom,"Why is the Karlovac theatre called the Zorin dom? Is tih some Zora''s home? Yes, in a way. It is the home of Zora, the first Croatian choir. And at one point in the 19th century, Zora decided to build its own home. Through singing and melodious performances, with the help of a united town, Zora conducted the building works and opened the Karlovac theatre. The beautiful building is the pride of Karlovac and its citizens and has become a symbol of is culture, connecting all generations. The huge wooden door will open up for you and take you to the world of comedy, drama, ballet, puppets and the magical sounds of the choir. Theatre, originating in ancient Greece, when the plays were dedicated to Dionysus, has for centuries been seen as the essential part of the urban culture of any self-respecting town. It has become a symbol of man's creativity and a cradle of culture. Theatre buildings are often the most beautiful parts of the urban architecture, and so it is with the Zorin dom, too, in its second century, with its proud role, as one of the Karlovac symbols, surrounded by parks. Sometimes, during the quiet Karlovac nights, while sitting on a bench in the Zorin dom park, you can hear the soprano singing and let your mind wander back to the age of great formal balls. It is not hard, it is just that we sometimes tend to forget. Let the actors be your guide, you can change your roles depending on the play you want to turn you life into. If you want to dance - just dance! Be a part of the great theatre of life. And when everything goes quiet again, sit in front of the Zorin dom and be thankful for the moment in which you're the only one in the leading role."
80,Karlovac,The Karlovac food market,"Bread, milk, potatoes, apples, cheese and cream... these are the staples of everyone''s market shopping list in Karlovac. But that is not all! While buying carrots, sauerkraut and lettuce, you''ll also get the farmer''s smile for free, maybe also a comment on the joys of life or a piece of advice regarding the dish you plan to prepare. And if you return the compliment, you''ll be the privileged customer forever. That is the true spirit of the Karlovac food market! This is the most colourful and the noisiest place in town, smelling of fruit and buzzing with customers and sellers. Like in a sort of a tolerance duty-free zone, among the customers here you'll find vegetarians, vegans, fruitarians, macrobiotics fans and the extreme meat lovers buying their produce in perfect peace and harmony. Also, here you'll find you first-door neighbour, Marija. Mornings are always the merriest time of the day at the market, while the cheapest period is around noon. Locals have their own favourite stands, and all the stands with home-grown produce are manned by the producers. We like to use endearing names for them. They are the best nutritionists with lots of experience in traditional diet, the wisdom passed on from one generation to the next. Just ask why sauerkraut is so healthy in winter. Our producers are scientists in disguise. Markets are important elements of any town's identity preservation. Although containing history, they are not going to take you on a journey through it, but will refine your present. Some say that the way to somebody's heart is through their stomach. Taste the home-grown apples from the Karlovac area, the fresh, unprocessed milk, or the traditional 'pork crisps' or 'pork chips' called čvarci. Yes, we have that, too! Remember the fairytales your grandmother used to tell you before sleep? There's a basket of food in each one. Little Red Riding Hood taking the food to her grandmother, Snow White and her apples, Cinderella and her pumpkin... each tale features some kind of food in a prominent role. We won't bore you with the symbolic meaning of food. We just want you to feel full and happy. And that you remember your visit to the Karlovac market as a fairytale with a happy ending."
80,Karlovac,The Gliboki Brod farm,"If you''re looking for some peace and quiet in the natural surroundings, there''s a small paradise near Karlovac that''s meant just for you - Gliboki Brod. You can reach the estate either by land or by water, choosing your means of transportation: on a bicycle, a car or a historic grain boat ride to the neighbouring billage. If you like the quiet river surroundings, the latter option will be ideal for you. The traditional Marinković family farm is hidden in the picturesque Kupa valley village of Brežani, surrounded by centuries-old oak forest. The traditional farming has now been enriched by a new kind of offer - agrotourism. And so, here you can learn the forgotten methods of land cultivation, encounter a goat or sheep herd, spend some time with two beautiful horses, Munja („Lightning"") and Grom („Thunder""), and treat you palate to the homemade nettle juice, the bazlamača (a type of sweet cornbread) and some homemade bread. Do not forget to take along the childern, whether your own or some neighbout's: they're bound to enjoy the valuable outdoor lessons. Or just wake up your inner child and go there by yourself. Pick some strawberries, taste the local plum jam, take a stroll to the natural spring with cool water, bring back your childhood memories. Let this farm be your escape from the everyday life. Learn something new in this age of forgotten skills and crafts and enjoy the smell of grass, the sound of wind and the birds' chirping. Order a homemade lunch, copy one of grandma Marijana's recipes, let your welcoming hosts guide you. And if you're lucky, while walking along the river bank, you might find a piece of a shell from the former Pannonian sea and can try to imagine you were really standing on the shore of that ancient sea."
81,Kastav and Klana,Kastav and Klana,"The town of Kastav and its surroundings are synonymous with rich history, geographical diversity, interesting architecture and a unique tourist offer. Situated, as one poet said ""ponad mora, kano soko"" (""""above the sea, like a hawk""""), so similar and yet so different from other towns in this region, with its soul in a nest made of stone, it is large enough for everyone willing to experience it in its wholeness. Kastav gives something to everyone and at the same time receives something in return. One who has listened once to the echo of their footsteps on the ancient cobblestone that many have walked before returns to it over and over again. Kastav invites a silent dialogue between the past and the present. It is when the closeness of a person and a city develops into something greater and more meaningful. Aware of its charm, yet never self-sufficient, Kastav is waiting for you! Active holidays, outdoors & nature The beautiful forests of Loza and Lužina that surround Kastav are the perfect place for an escape from everyday life. It only takes a few steps from the centre of Kastav to immerse yourself in the idyll of Kastav forests, walk along marked and themed trails, conquer the Kastav peaks and enjoy the view extending from them. Right behind Crekvina, electric bicycles are waiting for you, which can be used on the same tracks as the more common two wheeled bikes. Walking & Hiking Trail: Kastav - Eko-staza - Majevi vrh - Kastav (Snail) The snail, a creature whose movement is slow and limited but which is also very persistent, leads you through some interesting parts of Loza Forest that feature diverse karst formations and varied vegetation. It goes past the Sivi Vrabac ranch, follows the eco-trail and goes past the remains of the former ‘japnenice' limekilns, where lime was produced in the past. The old boundary trail along the former Rapallo Border climbs up to the rocky peak of Majevi Vrh (411 m) and a viewpoint that offers magnificent views of the surroundings. The trail leads back to Kastav via Spinčićev Breg. Trail: Kastav - Zvirić - Stanić - Brajani - Kastav trail (The rabbit) The rabbit, a fast and quiet animal with alert senses, which has become a less common inhabitant of Kastav's forests, is your guide along the route that passes through the karst landscape of Loza and Lužina Forests with its numerous sinkholes, the most prominent being the deep Knež Dol. A forest road leading from Zvirić hunter's lodge takes you to a rest area from which a steep path leads past a chapel up to Stanić Peak (465 m). The route then descends to the village of Brajani. On your way, you'll encounter an old guard post along the former Rapallo Border, after which the trail descends to the abandoned village of Cari and returns to Kastav via Spinčićev Breg. Trail: Kastav - Jelovičani - Breza - Mačkov vrh - Šparožna jama - Stanić - Brajani - Kastav trail (The Deer) The deer, an elegant and fast animal that with some luck you can encounter along Kastav's walking trails, leads you along the forest roads of Loza and Lužina through the village of Jelovičani, past the Sebenjino hunter's lodge and the old frontier post, up to the church on the edge of the village of Breza, the northernmost point of the walking trail, crossing the old Rapallo Border twice. The climbs to the peaks of Mačkov Vrh (504 m) and Stanić (465 m) are particularly interesting. The cave of Šparožna Jama is located nearby. The trail returns to Kastav via the village of Brajani and the abandoned village of Cari. Culture & Heritage Culture & arts"

81,Kastav and Klana,Yasna Skorup Krneta,"Ambient art installation - objects made of metal and discarded items - displayed in the old town of Kastav, in front of Crekvina. This unusual artistic creation represents Kastav with its houses and recognisable bell tower... This picturesque miniature town tells us a story about the past, but also about the present inhabitants of this ancient town. Yasna's eternal source of inspiration are Istrian hilltop towns, to which she always attributes some symbolic meaning, like the ""town in the arms of the earth"", or the ""town in the bosom of the universe"". This story of Kastav should also be viewed in this context. Kastav's ancient stone houses, which have been taken as the model, symbolise the origins, fireplace, refuge, protection, stability, life energy, and duration."
81,Kastav and Klana,Alley of Splendours,"Vladimir Nazor, the famous Croatian writer who spent ten years as the headmaster of Kastav's Primary School Teacher's Training College where he started to use čakavian dialect (link to the song), greets visitors at the beginning of the alley. A few steps uphill there is a bust of Ivan Matetić Ronjgov, a musicologist and a composer who set the theoretical basis of the so-called Istrian scale and a true lover of this region who painstakingly collected and noted the musical heritage of Istria, Primorje and the northern Adriatic islands. Based on those national treasures he wrote many authentic pieces of music. Next are the busts of the Istrian trio - Vjekoslav Spinčić, Matko Laginja and Matko Mandić - renowned for their enlightening work during the second half of the 19th century and the struggle for national, economic and political rights of the inhabitants of this area."
81,Kastav and Klana,Crekvina,"The history of the summer stage on the roof of Kvarner is interesting and a little mysterious. Crekvina is the largest church building on the Croatian littoral on the site of which once stood the Church of the Assumption of Mary, destroyed by devastating earthquakes in 1750 and 1754. In the 17th century, the Kastav lordship was acquired by the Jesuits, who used it, among other things, to finance their construction projects of which Crekvina was one of them. Construction began in the 18th century and was never completed as in 1773 the Jesuit order was dissolved. It was 50 metres long, 20 metres high and wide and could accommodate more than 3,000 believers. It is known that the Kastav region at that time had 7,000 inhabitants, so it is easy to conclude what a huge project it was. Only a few folk legends about its construction have been preserved. In front of the historical remains a square was landscaped whilst today Crekvina itself is an ideal place for concerts and stage performances."
81,Kastav and Klana,Fortica,Fortica was once one of the town forts protecting the access to Kastav's town gate (Voltica) and the town Loggia. Today is a favourite resting place in the shade of a century-old wild chestnut tree with a stunning view of Kvarner and Učka. The entrance to Fortica is decorated with a flagpole (the so called štandar) with engraved words Kastav in the Constitutional Year of 1861 and two interpretation boards - one depicting the old part of the town and the other introducing visitors to the Halubje bell ringers and their procession.
81,Kastav and Klana,Lokvina,"A small Mediterranean square and the heart of Kastav. It was named after a pond in which rainwater was collected and used for the town's needs. Although this pond is much better known because the people of Kastav drowned the hated captain Fran Morelli in it. At the end of the 17th century, a cistern was built in memory of this event, on the throat of which was engraved the year of the Kastav rebellion - 1666. When the Kastav lordship was formed at the end of the 15th century, the town castle (Kaštel) was built and inhabited by captains (governors) who managed the entire Kastav region instead of the owner. Opposite the castle is the chapel of the Holy Trinity or Three Saints as the locals call it. It was built at the beginning of the 15th century using ashlar masonry and is painted with frescoes inscribed in 1483. Today it is used as a gallery although it is particularly lively during the Kastav Cultural Summer Festival when local artists and those from other parts of the country and abroad present their works."
81,Kastav and Klana,The town Loggia,"Kastav's Loggia is the biggest and best preserved loggia on Kvarner, built in 1571 during the time of Captain Pavle Zadranin. The town Loggia was the place where the Council convened and, if necessary it was used as a courtroom as well. The most amusing time in the  Loggia was during Bela nedeja and other fairs when it was a place for dancing, singing and entertaining. Today's function does not differ too much from the previous one, because on June 6th Kastav town's feast Day, a solemn session of the Town Council is held inside the Loggia."
81,Kastav and Klana,Town walls,"Kastav's walls are one of the most fully preserved complexes of town walls, built from the 9th to the 16th century. In the Middle Ages, they were expanded, so Kastav became a town surrounded by stone walls with nine towers. They were built as a fort within a fort. The outer part was formed by a defensive wall around the entire settlement whilst the inner one was the fortification around the parish church. Along the outer walls, whose circumference is about 750 metres, there were nine towers of which six are preserved today. The inner wall was once guarded by three towers that formed a plateau with the church of St Helen the Cross Bearer. The highest Kastav tower even today is called Žudika where various verdicts were once carried out, allegedly even burning witches. Food & Drink"

There is the story about the Halubje bell ringers, whose uniqueness was recognised and protected by UNESCO bacin in 2010 - adding them to its list of intangible cultural heritage. Did you know that only the Halubje bell ringers were allowed to wear masks that covered their entire face and head?

Carnival is also known as Pust, after the straw puppets that personify the worst misfortunes and sins of the entire community and which are burned at Carnival time.

82,Kaštela,Culture and art,"Kaštel Gomilica Kaštel Gomilica King Zvonimir in the year 1078 granted an estate in the Field of Kaštela to the convent of Benedictine nuns. A pre-Romanic church of St. Kuzma and Damjan was built there in the 12th century, over remains of an ancient necropolis and an early-Christian church (findings of early-Christian sarcophagi). The relics of St. Virgin Mary, St. Kuzma and Damjan, and the king Stephen of Hungay are kept there near a Roman villa rustica. An oak, over 700 years old, stands in front of the church, under which, according to the legend, Croatian king Zvonimir rested there once. The old parish church from the 18th century is noted for its carved Baroque doors. Fulgencije Bakotić, a wood carver and a priest was born in Kaštel Gomilica in the 18th century. He was well-known for his crucifixes. One of them is in the parish church, two in the Poljud monastery, one in the Museum of the Town of Kaštela and a few in Italian monasteries. Private accommodation offers various possibilities of tourist reception. Kaštel Kambelovac Kaštel Kambelovac North of Kruševik in the Lažana region the medieval church of St. Mihovil was built on the slope of Kozjak of the same name. In the area of Kaštel Kambelovac castles of Grissogono i Lipeo families have been built. Peasants from an old Croatian village Kruševik built two castles, Velika and Mala Piškera. It was the only example where peasants have built their fortresses. Due to the large number of castles Kaštel Kambelovac developed in a stretched village. On the slopes of Kozjak is a little church of St. Martin od Kruševika, former center of the Kruševik village. Today this church is known as Gospe na Krugu or Gospe od Snijega. There is a guard house from the 16th century on the western side of the slope and a fortress Kaštilica near the summit of the mountain. Marked paths lead to these churches and mountain houses under Koludar (325 m) and Orlovo gnijezdo. Farther uphill and to the northeast mountaineers would exit to the ridge of Kozjak over slick vertical cliff secured by a steel rope. From there the path leads to Veliki vrj (780 m), the highest point of Kozjak. The upper part of the path is only for experienced mountaineers. Kaštel Lukšić Kaštel Lukšić In the western part of modern Kaštel Lukšić Mihovil Rosani built his castle in 1482. This is an obvious example that castles were built on the sea reefs. There was a small village around Rušinac, which was abandoned due to security reasons. The church of St. Ivan is there. it consisted of residential two-story building with balcony and emergency exit to the sea on the south side and of two defensive keeps and a drawbridge as a connection with the mainland on the northern side. The drawbridge was replaced with a one-arc stone bridge in the 18th century. In the center of the castle is a yard with arcades and galleries on the 1st and 2nd floor. The Museum of the Town of Kaštela, the Tourism Board of Kaštela and some cultural institutions found their place in the renovated Vitturi castle today. It becomes a cultural center of the town. Exhibitions, concerts, theatre shows take place there. A village with a defensive wall was built around the castle. The Gothic - Renaissance Gospe od Uznesenja church is on the northern edge of the old village and was built in 1530 in the Gothic style. The new parish church was built from 1776 -1817 in the Late Baroque style. Is a real treasury of artwork, paintings and statues. It keeps a Piazzetta''s Baroque crucifix (17th century), an chalice cover of Palma Junior (16th century) - ""Madonna's Assumption"", a painting ""Madonna with the child"" (15th century) at the main altar, the altar grave of St. Arnir, a work of Juraj Dalmatinac (15th century). There is also the Tataglia - Ambrossini castle in Lukšić. Dr. Henrik Šoulavy from Prague visited Kaštela in 1903, bought that castle, and in it in 1909 opened the first pension in Kaštela. The classicistic-style Vitturi Park from the second part of the 18th century is in the immediate vicinity of the castle. He was founded by Radoš Micheli Vitturi. It was declared a monument of park architecture in 1968. This park and only a few others like Gučetić''s in Trsteno, Garanjin''s in Trogir and Borelli''s in u St. Filip and Jakov are the rare monuments of this kind. Not far from the Vitturi park stands the border stone pylon which marked border between domains of noblemen from Trogir and Split. Beneath Kozjak, on the Balavan ridge (259 m) there is the church of St. Lovre od Ostroga. Ostrog was a village where didići (free peasants working on their own land) had their centre. This village was first mentioned in 1171. The settlement was built on remains of Roman and Illyrian settlements. The church of St. Ivan Biranj (637 m) was built at the highest part of the western Kozjak where an Illyrian fort once was. On the St. Ivan Biranj''s Day the head of the village was elected, and that is probably why the church got that name. Kaštel Lukšić is well known for its Miljenko and Dobrila legend. They were Romeo and Juliet of Kaštela, lovers whose love, even though they married, ended tragically. Hotel Kastel, Villa Žarko and private accommodation are guarantees for every visitor''s pleasant vacation. There is also the Tataglia - Ambrossini castle in Lukšić. Dr. Henrik Šoulavy from Prague visited Kaštela in 1903, bought that castle, and in it in 1909 opened the first pension in Kaštela.

This park and only a few others like Gučetić''s in Trsteno, Garanjin''s in Trogir and Borelli''s in u St. Filip and Jakov are the rare monuments of this kind. Not far from the Vitturi park stands the border stone pylon which marked border between domains of noblemen from Trogir and Split. Beneath Kozjak, on the Balavan ridge (259 m) there is the church of St. Lovre od Ostroga. Ostrog was a village where didići (free peasants working on their own land) had their centre. This village was first mentioned in 1171. The settlement was built on remains of Roman and Illyrian settlements. The church of St. Ivan Biranj (637 m) was built at the highest part of the western Kozjak where an Illyrian fort once was. On the St. Ivan Biranj''s Day the head of the village was elected, and that is probably why the church got that name. Kaštel Lukšić is well known for its Miljenko and Dobrila legend. They were Romeo and Juliet of Kaštela, lovers whose love, even though they married, ended tragically. Hotel Kastel, Villa Žarko and private accommodation are guarantees for every visitor''s pleasant vacation.

His other work is stored in the Studin gallery and not available for public at the moment. The church of Gospa od Špiljana or Stomorija in the Field of Kaštela was built and founded as a privilege in 1189 by didići from the Špiljani village. They gained right to elect a parson who was provided for by the income of the privilege. A fragment of an old-Christian relief which displays two dolphins and a cross was built in the wall of the church''s apse. The church is surrounded by hundreds-of-years-old trees. There is a spring in the yard of the church. Due to all these fact this was an ideal place to establish the Biblical Garden in honor of the first visit of the Pope John Paul II to Croatia. All plants mentioned in the Bible already grow or will be planted in the garden. The Biblical Garden was designed by Dobrila Kraljić and architect Edo Šegvić. In the field above Kaštel Novi vineyards were cultivated from ancient times. They were decimated by phylloxera in the 19th century and renewed with new vine species. Only a few old species left, and among them Crljenak kaštelanski, which is known in the world and especially in California as Zinfandel. The homeland of the American vine is Kaštel Novi where a few vines still grow in the vineyard of Mr. Radunić. Vine species of Crljenak kaštelanski found its place in the Biblical Garden. Kaštel Novi offers possibility of stay in private accommodation. Kaštel Štafilić Kaštel Štafilić A rectangle-shaped settlement was formed arround the castle, surrounded by a ditch.

An olive older than 1500 years, an exceptional natural monument, grows in Kaštel Štafilić. It originates from Southern Italy or Greece. This old olive (Olea Europea) is locally called Mastrinka. It was declared a monument of nature in 1990. Annual crop of olives is processed into oil which is packed into replicas of glass lacrimatoriums. This is an autochthonous souvenir of Kaštela.

Artifacts from this site are kept in the Croatian Museum of Archeological Monuments in Split (big ciborium) and in the Museum of the Town of Kaštela. Present church was built by don Frane Bulić next to the ruins of St. Marta in 1908. Numerous findings are proof that Croatian people''s rulers had their seat here. In the Trpimir''s deed of donation of 4 March 852 is written: """"Ja knez Hrvata"""" (""""I duke of Croats"""") and """"Učinjeno u mjestu koje se zove Bijaći"""" (""""Made at a place called Bijaći"""").

An olive (Olea Europea), more than 1500 years old grows in Kaštel Štafilić, which people of Kaštela call Mastrinka. It is considered that it was brought from Southern Italy or Greece. Due to the fact that estates of the Roman were in this area, it was presumed to be a remnant of an agricultural estate from those times. The olive is of an oil-producing species with small leaves and fruits. The system of roots occupies space of more than 100 meters. The span of the tree is 6 meters, the span of the tree top is 22 meters and the height is 10 meters. Annual crop of olives is processed into oil and packed into replicas of glass lacrimatoriums as an autochthonous souvenir of Kaštela.

Vid attest to their presence here. Another hillfort, known as Donji Gradac, was used as a settlement of the Liburnians from the same period, but the ancient walls of that settlement were sadly destroyed due to the construction of the road connecting Kolan and Mandre some thirty years ago. The human settlement of this area is also evidenced by the numerous ancient burial sites (where bronze jewellery was found, among other) scattered across the nearby pastures. The continuity of settlement carries on into the time of Roman rule in these parts, as evidenced by the numerous remains of Roman villae rusticae on the edges of Kolan Field (Kavrle, Ograda, Polačine, Jurevice, Rnakovac, Lazić, Didine, Stomorica). The name Kolan probably comes from the Roman water supply system (Lat. canalis), bringing water from Kolan Field (well) to Cisse near Novalja. Kolan is first mentioned as a settlement in historical records of a response of the Council of Venice to the Council of Pag dated 2 March 1441, when the Council of Venice gave its permission for the construction of a settlement in an area known as Kolan. The parish church in Kolan dates back from the same year. In the area of the cadastral municipality of Kolan (within the same boundaries of today's municipality), sit the following partially preserved medieval churches: Church of St. Vitus dating back to 1348 and located in the highest point of the island, Church of St. Mark dating back to 1493, Church of the Holy Spirit dating back to 1391, Church of St. Mary dating back to 1393, and Church of St. Jerome - built in the late 15th or early 16th century on a small hill in the centre of Kolan Field. The ruins of old walls built using plaster, and an abundance of Roman pottery and several broken columns, suggest that this was the location of a Roman estate (villa rustica) or rural settlement. Throughout its history, Kolan was primarily a settlement of workers living off agriculture and sheep farming, as well as fishing in the nearby Mandre and Šimuni. Also, Kolan used to have a mine in the area of Kolan Field (Vele Grbe and Male Grbe) where coal was mined for many years."
86,Kolan,Dry stone walls,"Dry stone walls are not only part of the cultural heritage of Dalmatia, but also of the island of Pag. They were originally built to separate land into sections, and nowadays they are a must-see tourist attraction on the island. What makes them special is exactly their simplicity - they are built using only natural stone. In our field, you can see the hard work of our ancestors who built these impressive walls thanks to their hard work and patience. Apart from separating land into sections, they also provide a place of shelter for various animals and plants."
86,Kolan,Pag cheese,"No cheese stays unchanged from the moment it was created to the moment it is consumed. Cheese has different ""life stages"" and specific properties in each of them. From the day milk curdles and young cheese is taken out of the mould, to its maturing and slow drying, in rooms with a constant level of humidity and without draught, diligent hands turn it over each day, cover it with butteroil, and take care of it until it has fully matured, and when it melts on the tongue and is bursting with flavour, showering the palate with the bora wind, the salt, the grass, the rocks, the strength and the tradition. All this is incorporated into Pag cheese, served on its own or with prosciutto, olive oil, figs or grapes, best paired with warm home-baked bread and a glass of good wine. We are proud to say that Pag cheese was entered in the register of protected designations of origin in 2019. Two of the most well-known cheese dairies on the island of Pag are located in Kolan: Gligora Dairy and MIH Dairy. Also, Pag cheese can be tasted and bought in many smaller cheese dairies and family-owned farms in the area of Kolan and Mandre."
86,Kolan,Curd and butteroil,"Considering that the milk made from Pag sheep is rich in milk fat, after we make the cheese, the whey (locally known as surotva) is heated and gently stirred and brought to a boil. From the whey another cheese is separated, known as skuta (curd) on Pag, a soft and melting cheese used as a spread or as a filling for cakes and pancakes. The whey that contained curd was used as drink, and whey that didn't was fed to pigs used to make the special prosciutto of Pag, another of its specialities. Butteroil was made in a churn, known locally as stap, by churning curd and mixing it with water. After a while, the finest butter would rise up to the surface, and was used as a spread on bread. By boiling it, the locals made butteroil for pastry, seasoning for polenta or rice and other local Kolan dishes. This product is not as popular as curd or cheese, but it can still be found in certain households. As final evidence of the richness of the milk made from Pag sheep, we will close with this. At the end of the process, the buttermilk remaining after the butteroil had been separated was cooked to extract curd known locally as skutina that was turned in a special process into soap for washing clothes."
86,Kolan,Kolan Ethnographic collection,"The Kolan ethnographic collection was established in 1978 by the Bartul Kašić Culture and Arts Association. The collection consists of various objects offering a glimpse into the everyday life of this small settlement, and its set-up, conceptually divided into two sections - tavern and household, tells the story of the life and work of the people of Kolan. Agriculture, and especially wine growing, were of major importance for Kolan. It is the only green patch of land in northern Pag. However, its greatest treasure were its sheep and sheep farming. They provided the islanders with milk, cheese and meat, as well as with wool to make clothes and keep warm. The current display of the collection tells of the importance of fertile land and sheep, but also of hard work. The ploughing devices, different agricultural tools, as well as tools used in wine growing, reflect the community's connection to the land. The household objects show the value of sheep and their wool, as well as of continuous work which carried vital importance in the rugged conditions on the island of Pag. Even though this collection is aimed at showcasing the history of Kolan and the life of its people, those who created it at the end of the last century were primarily led by the love they had for their home, community and place they lived in, and that same love has brought the collection back to life today."
86,Kolan,Kolanjsko blato - Rogoza,"As a special ornithological reserve, Kolanjsko Blato has been protected since 1988 and is one of the few remaining Mediterranean wetlands, formed during the Pleistocene period, 13,000 years ago. It covers an area of 172.21 ha and is home to 163 bird species, 66 of which are nesting birds. These include the great reed warbler, wild duck, little grebe, heron, wader, water rail, lark, tern, and common moorhen. This site also attracts ornithologists, amateur bird watchers, as well as those who want to enjoy untouched nature. The area is specific for its immediate vicinity to the sea and the beach on one side, and a view of pastures and Velebit on the other."
86,Kolan,Lamb festival,"Kolan isn't famous only for its cheese and curds - it also takes pride in its lamb, which has been awarded EU's Protected Designation of Origin. Baby lamb meat from Pag owes its rich and exquisite taste to the free range grazing of the sheep, the sheep milk and wild herbs growing in the barren rocky terrain of Pag. Thanks to this rearing method, the lamb from Pag has its distinctive and recognisable flavour. The very essence of their diet, rich in essential oils, lies in the island's herbs - sage, heather, thyme - and the special flavour of the Pag lamb wouldn't be there without the salt sediment carried by the bora winds. The festival is held every June in Mandre, and besides spit-roasted lamb, you can also try boiled mutton prepared in the traditional Kolan way, as well as other culinary delights from local restaurants and family farms."

This is precisely why Kolan organises the Skutafest, a festival of cheese curd, to honour this product every May. Cheese curd is an exquisite and healthy delicacy resulting from the production of the Pag cheese, meaning that it is in season for only a short period of time, in limited quantities. Apart from the curd, another healthy by-product is the whey, rich in vitamins and proteins, used for numerous health issues.

88,Konavle,Watermills on River Ljuta,"There is a system of watermills and stamp mills built on river Ljuta which consisted of eight watermills for flour, two watermills for oil and three stamp mills. When the Dubrovnik Republic bought Konavle, there were four mills on the upper stream of the river. After 1550, the system called ""lower mills"" was built and has been preserved until today. The functioning of the mills was based on a canal system, and some of them were driven by three aqueducts. Most of the buildings were on the western bank apart from the Đivanović stamp mill, which was on the eastern bank. The mill system was extremely important for the economy of Konavle and the Republic as a whole. The river source and the upper stream is under protection of the Government as a park of nature, whereas the watermill is protected as a cultural monument. The site is located on a hill near village Dubravka.

The Konavle traditional costumes, especially the women's costumes, in a special way embody the centuries-old culture of living of the local population because of its beauty, elegance and aesthetics, and down to the present day it is perhaps the most beautiful representative of the Croatian folklore treasure. Due to the harmony of the natural materials, out of which it is made, the ornaments of the Konavle embroidery, the jewels and the single pieces of clothing the Konavle women's costumes confer to the women of Konavle, who are beauties anyway, in a unique way a very particular elegance throughout her entire life, from the girl's age to the ripe old age.

Originally, it was stitched with silk, won from the cocoons of the silk moth, carefully and attentively grown in each Konavle house and dyed with natural colours. The strictly symmetrical and geometrical motives in countless forms were mostly worked out in red, black, and dark-green colour with a golden-yellow border. Because of its beauty and the extreme adaptability, the Konavle embroidery is applied to many of today's objects of utility (table-cloths, purses, decorative elements for evening gowns, table mats, pillowslips, spectacle cases, framed pictures of the Konavle embroidery and other). This way, the tradition of the handcraft is kept up, and thus Konavle is world-wide promoted in the best way."

88,Konavle,Konavle,"Konavle - a place in the very south of Croatia, is the most southern part of today's Dubrovnik Riviera, with whose purchase the Dubrovnik Republic rounded off its territory in the 15th century. Konavle is a region with particular natural beauties and contrasts: mountain and valley, green hills and naked stone, the blue and the green or, as called by the inhabitants of Konavle, ""Gornja"" and ""Donja Banda"". Fringed by the Konavle mountains in the North, bordered by the Adriatic Sea in the South, it reaches from the entry into the Bay of Kotor to the peninsula of Prevlaka in the East, and in the West, it inclines down to the cosy coves of Obod and Cavtat. The preserved natural, unique and exceptionally precious rural architecture, numerous monuments of the thousand-year-old history of this area, traditions that are hundreds of years old and have been kept through folklore, the distinctive traditional costumes of Konavle and the Konavle embroidery, the harmony of man's life and the nature ...all this renders Konavle unique and recognisable."
88,Konavle,Cavtat,"Cavtat is the largest and the only urban centre in Konavle that has been built up deliberately. It is located on the peninsula of Rat, which surrounds the well protected and accessible bay together with the peninsula of Sustjepan. In its harmonious architecture, the centuries-old natural, spiritual and material affiliation to the Dubrovnik Republic can be observed. Cavtat, the antique Epidaurus, was an important Roman colony in this region, which expires after the breakthrough of the Slavs and the Avarians into this area after the decline of the Western Roman Empire, and their inhabitants flee to the neighbouring settlement Laus-Rave-Ragus, wherefrom Dubrovnik arose. In historical sources, Cavtat is also mentioned with the name Ragusa Vecchia, what clearly testifies to the connection of these two cities. In the times of the Dubrovnik Republic, Cavtat was the second most important seaport, place of trade and of administration in the Republic after Dubrovnik. Places like Cavtat offering so much to the visitors are quite rare. Its scenery, the rich cultural and historical heritage along with the range of services offered to tourists meet the demands of the present day tourists, thus making it one of the most attractive destinations on the Adriatic coast. Cavtat is located between the magic city of Dubrovnik on one side and beautiful Konavle on the other. There one can still feel the spirit of the past time and experience the centuries old tradition of our ancestors. It is an ideal holiday resort. Each visitor can discover his own wishes, enjoy the hidden coves at peace, long walks at the seaside or spend active holidays going in for recreational sports and entertaining cultural programmes. Čilipi Čilipi, a place next to Cavtat and Gruda, is the biggest settlement in Konavle and surely the best place to meet the traditions of Konavle. In the centre of the place with the largest church in Konavle, the parish church of St. Nicholas, a square formed up, surrounded by official and family stone houses, in order to create a unique urban micro unit. The stairs, slightly descending from the church to the plateau of the square, became an ideal stage for numerous visitors of folklore events that have been organised in Čilipi each Sunday from Easter to the end of October for over three decades. Thereby we preserve our folklore and cultural heritage, and that offers the tourists a unique experience of an encounter with our ancestors' traditions, still alive. In Čilipi, the homeland house of Konavle can be found, a museum that bears rich ethnographic source material from the entire region of Konavle, and that is presented in the authentic ambience of the Konavle stone house. Closely nearby Čilipi the international airport of Dubrovnik is located, which has contributed extraordinarily to the touristic development of this region and to the approximation of this region to the world during the past decades."

91,Kostrena,Archaeological heritage,"Počivala Stop and rest for a while, you're in the right spot! This is a rest stop. It is in fact a wall that used to be used for putting down the load carried by washerwomen - women who would, back in the 18th, 19th and early 20th century, come from remote villages scattered across the Kostrena peninsula to do laundry on the ""Stara voda"" beach and at ""Perilo"" freshwater spring in Žurkovo cove. They would sometimes just lean against one of these 1 m high and 2 m long walls, with the carrying baskets still on their backs, for a moment of respite during the arduous ascent. In fact, doing the laundry used to be one of the hardest chores, reserved only for women! At a time before there was running water or washing machines, all the clothes and linen were washed by hand, at the side of a river, creek, ponds, public wells or in the sea. Laundry was done on average every three weeks, and the entire process usually took five days.  Because they had to walk a hard route and carry a heavy load, the women would often work in pairs. Hardworking women of Kostrena used to repeat this painstaking process at least once a month and every good homemaker took special pride in her white and sparkling clean laundry. And rightfully so!"
91,Kostrena,Solin Hill,"On Solin Hill lies the prehistoric hillfort of the same name, which was part of the late Roman barrier system known as Claustra Alpium Iuliarum. This system, active between the 3rd and 5th centuries, guarded the passes leading into Italy. The stone walls, which were sometimes arranged in multiple rows, were complemented by towers, hillforts, and fortresses. This formidable system extended from present-day Rijeka in Croatia to Bačka Grapa in Slovenia."
91,Kostrena,Sopalj hill,"On the eastern edge of the Municipality of Kostrena, on the dominant stony, Sopalj hill from where a panoramic view extends over the Bakar Bay and Kvarner islands is the large prehistoric settlement, the Sopalj castle, a spacious area surrounded by two layers of walls. Sopalj was founded during the Bronze Age, in the second millennium BC, and as a surveillance and guarding station had the function of supervising access to the Bakar Bay almost until the present day.

Educational Trail ""Kostrenska Počivala"" This trail offers an opportunity to immerse yourself in the beauty of Kostrena and uncover fragments of its rich history. It reminds us of a time when life here was far from easy, especially for women. While their husbands were at sea, women carried the burden of numerous household chores, including one of the most demanding tasks - washing laundry. Laundry was washed at freshwater springs, such as those on the beaches of Perilo and Stara Voda. This laborious process, repeated every three weeks, could take up to five days. After washing, women carried heavy bundles of laundry uphill on their backs, making their way home. Due to the effort required and the weight of the load, they often worked in pairs, finding strength in their companionship. Along the way, stone walls known as *počivala* served as their sanctuaries. These were not just resting spots where they could set down their loads and catch their breath - they were also centers of social life. At these spots, women would meet, share stories, laughter, sorrow, and news, briefly forgetting the hardships that lay ahead. Today, the ""Kostrenska Počivala"" come to life on interpretive panels installed along the new trail. Walking this path, you step into a story told by the footsteps of women - the washerwoman's. Kostrena Seamen's House ""Navigare necesse est"" - the saying sailing is obligatory reflects the mystical bond between man and sea, as old as existence itself. When it comes to Kostrena, sailing means living, because here, sailing is a way of life."

94,Krapina,Description of destination Krapina,"Krapina is today the cultural, political and administrative centre of Krapina-Zagorje County. Approximately 13,000 people live in the town of Krapina. The fact that Krapina is the political centre of the county has historical roots. Krapina County (comitatus crappinensis) was mentioned as early as 1222 in the 1222 charter of Duke Bela where prince Petar of Krapina was named the head of the Croatian noble parish (Petar ""comes de Crapuna""). King Sigismund of Croatia and Hungary, who owned an estate in Krapina (Castrum Carpone), awarded the mayor of the town of Krapina the title of the Great Count of Zagorje County in 1399. During the administration of ban Ivan Drašković, five sessions of the Croatian Parliament were held in Krapina at the turn of the 17th century. Ante Starčević, the Father of the Nation, and bishop Juraj Strossmayer, signed political agreements in Krapina that defended Croatia's interests. Today, Krapina-Zagorje County is a territorial administration and self-governing unit that unites all the towns of the Croatian Zagorje region, without limiting the autonomy of any of them. It emphasises the unity of the region rather than its constituent parts and creates a whole that has ""Zagorje in its heart"" (a local saying). The best time to visit the Croatian region of Zagorje is the autumn when the days are clear, the skies are blue, and the treetops turn gold. There is no better time to look at the Zagorje hills from which you will be able to see undulating green, brown, yellow and blue colours, white roads which joyfully meander among the villages and into the forests or other hidden corners which escape the eye. You will see houses scattered around the hills and cattle on the pastures. The wind will carry the scent of grapes from vineyards and the scent of apples from the orchards. In autumn, the forests soon bear ripe chestnuts. While looking at Zagorje from one of its many hilltops, even if only for a moment, you will feel like the Creator himself when He was creating the world and ""all the evils, troubles and doubts suddenly become small..."" in the words of the famous Croatian poet, Dobriša Cesarić. Is this the reason why the chapels of Zagorje are built on the highest hilltops.

An amateur theatre society was also active during the period, and their first performance was on 29 August 1841. In 1847 the first Croatian opera ""Ljubav i zloba"" (Love and Malice) by Vatroslav Lisinski was performed in Krapina. Today, the house in which Ljudevit Gaj was born, which still stands in Ljudevit Gaj Street, houses a Memorial Museum. Most of the exhibits are connected to Dr Gaj and his personal life. 3. Old town From the Krapina medieval fortress - a town on a hill above Krapina, only one building has been preserved, which in 1919 its owner Franjo Baron Ottenfels donated with the remains of the hillfort to the Krapina municipality. The old town is a place of peculiar silence and peace. The oldest owners of the city were the Hungarian and Croatian kings. Important lords of the town of Krapina were the princes of Celje, the Croatian ban Vitovac, Keglevići. At the time of Ivan Drašković's banishment, five Croatian Parliaments were sitting in Krapina: 1598, 1599, 1600, 1605 and 1607. The last lords of the town of Krapina were the Lichtenberg and Ottenfels families. 4. St Nicholas' Parish Church The Krapina parish is the oldest of all under the archdeacon of Zagorje, as early as 1193. A number of gold objects of artistic value dating from between the 17th and 19th centuries which were once part of the collection at the old church are still preserved - the cross, chalices from the late gothic, early baroque, baroque and rococo periods, baroque reliquaries, pyx and thurible. In the new church (1901-1904) , which was inspired by the old gothic church and designed by the architect Josip Vrancaš, the most valuable item is the organ built by the famous organ builder F. Heferer, dating from 1903. There was once also a graveyard surrounding the parish church. This is the church where the life of people from Krapina begins and ends; it is the place where the sacraments of baptism, matrimony and holy orders are celebrated and masses for the dead and other rituals are held. 5. Franciscan Monastery and St Catherine's Church Franciscan Monastery and St Catherine's Church are dominant structure in Krapina's urban space. Similarly dominant is the influence of the Franciscans who have been active in Krapina from 17 April 1641 when the monastery was founded, thanks to Ana Marija Keglević-Erdödy and her brother Franjo Keglević. The monastery contains a rare collection of church art and a library founded in 1650, consisting of many rare books, the most significant of which are three incunabula. One of the most important figures of the monastery was Father Dominik Antolković who discovered the remains of the Krapina Neanderthal and informed Professor Gorjanović Kramberger about it. In the late 17th century and in the 18th century, the Franciscan monastery founded a university which offered courses in philosophy, moral theology, rhetoric and a novitiate, which greatly influenced the Revival Period in Krapina as well the period's key figure, Ljudevit Gaj. On the feast day of St Anthony the Abbot, patron saint of the fields and cattle, members of the parish bring offerings such as eggs, sausages, cereals, cheese and milk. On Pentecost they bring blessed water back home from the church, and on Candlemass Day they bring home a blessed candle which is lit in the event of a death taking place; on 13 October children wearing lily and rose flower decorations receive the blessing of St Anthony of Padua, while 25 November is the feast day of St Catherine. Here is also place for the concerts of religious music. 6. Church of Our Lady of Jerusalem at Trški Vrh Church of Our Lady of Jerusalem at Trški Vrh, built between 1750 and 1761, it is one of the most beautiful baroque churches in this part of Croatia. The Church of Our Lady of Jerusalem was built by the pious townspeople and villagers as their votive church. The church was built in order to safeguard a statue of Mary brought from Jerusalem. The very serenity and the beauty of the inside of the church are inspiring with its elaborately decorated altars from the Zagreb workshop of Anton Merz, its artistic paintings by Anton Lerchinger of Rogatec, and its organ by artisan Anton Römer of Graz. The church is surrounded by an octagonal wall and a small tower containing a chapel was built on each corner. Each summer, pilgrims arrive between May, June and October. 7. Town Gallery - the Majcen House One of the most famous houses in Krapina is the late 19th century house of the Majcen family, who were well-known lawyers. Many reputable names visited the family on a frequent basis, including the likes of J. J. Strossmayer and A. Starčević. Dr Vlatko Maček was a legal clerk with Dr Josip Majcen in 1912. The twentieth century and its wars meant the end of many reputable families. After the family went bankrupt during World War II, the Majcens became poor. Their only two direct successors, Zdenka and Nada, gave the house to the Town and wanted it to be turned into a gallery. The gallery was opened on the occasion of the 800th anniversary of the foundation of the town with the exhibition of the famous painter Edo Kovačević. During the past year, since its opening, the Gallery has hosted several exhibitions and it also houses the collection of paintings from the Kajkavian Song Festival (naive painters of the Kajkavian-speaking area) and the former Hušnjakovo Gallery (contemporary Croatian art). 8. The Presečki Old-Timer Museum The Presečki Old-Timer Museum is the fulfillment of a dream long dreamt by its conceptual creator - Antun Presečki, a passionate old-timer vehicle enthusiast. Having opened the museum, he has fulfilled his boyhood dream he had once had while intoxicated by gasoline fumes from a motorcycle that is now an exhibit with a special place within the museum. Over 25 years of committed collecting and restoring of vintage vehicles is summarized and presented to the public on 1,100 m2 of exhibition area where visitors are able to dive into the history of the car and motorcycle culture. The museum contains over twenty automobiles and over sixty motorcycles. The most prominent exhibits are cars dating back to the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but motorcycle enthusiasts will not leave empty handed either. Also presented within the museum are buses, bicycles, as well as other artifacts such as vintage photographs, magazines, books, posters and devices that bring to us the world of old-timers. 9. Historical centre of the town of Krapina Historical centre of the town of Krapina has been preserved until this day. It encompasses Gaj Street, Ljudevit Gaj Square, Magistrate's Street and the Croatian Cultural Revival Promenade. This area is an important contribution to the ambience of this small town, having preserved urban and architectural elements of historical significance. Many of the Classicist facades have been renovated and decorated with flowers, and some of them also feature details from the Secession/Modernist period. Today, Krapina remains a market town. The main streets are filled with shops, boutiques, restaurants and cafes luring the passersby with their tempting products. The centre of the town is its square bearing the name of one of the leading figures of the Croatian National Revival, Dr Ljudevit Gaj. The townsfolk of Krapina built him a monument as early as 1891, created by the sculptor Ivan Rendić. Gaj Square, the place where the main streets of the town meet, is the centre of Krapina and represents the very essence of the town - if you do not live in the centre, coming to the square means coming to Krapina. Krapina is a town which reflects a certain intimacy and closeness where everything is close by, near and connected. 10. Forma Prima Within the Hušnjakovo complex, on the Josipovac hill, there is a sculpture park Forma Prima, about forty sculptures in oak wood by famous domestic and foreign academic sculptors. The sculptures unite with the natural environment in which they are located and together with it symbolize fertility, flourishing, growth and the growing need of man to preserve nature as his destination.

96,Križevci,Church of the Holy Cross,"There are numerous stories of the origin of the Church of the Holy Cross. One of them says that as early as the 6th century, Croats, who had just settled in this area, experienced a great thirst, over the well that invigorated them, and experienced the vision of the cross when they received the Faith. A church was built on the same place and was named the church of the Holy Cross. This church is a witness to the most significant historical turmoil of this city and its surroundings and that is why, of all the famous buildings in the city, it is most implanted in the memory of its inhabitants. Church of the Holy Cross is not only the oldest preserved building in the city, but is one of the oldest churches in continental Croatia. It is mentioned in written sources as early as 1232. This church, marked by historical stratification, is characterized by some urban features. The church was built outside the walls of the Lower Town, inside a separate fortress. The interior of the church preserves a very valuable monument, the late Baroque marble altar from 1756, the work of Francesco Robba. The altar was carved for the needs of the Zagreb Cathedral, where it was located until its restoration at the end of the 19th century. According to experts, the altar is one of the most beautiful sculptural achievements of the late Baroque of this area, so it is not surprising that it is a special attraction for all tourists and guests who visit our city. Large painting of Oton Iveković stands on the port of the sanctuary with the depiction of the ""bloody assembly"". It was painted in 1914. Due to its width, which is over eight meters, it is one of authors greatest works."
96,Križevci,Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Trinity,"The Greek Catholic Cathedral of the Holy Trinity and the episcopal residence are the most representative sacral building and high-value monumental complex in Križevci. It was founded on the foundations of the Augustinian monastery from the 14th century, and later the Franciscan monastery from the 17th century. Križevci was assigned to the Greek Catholics by Empress Maria Theresa and Pope Pius VI as the seat of the diocese as early as 1777, but the Baroque architecture of the monastery and the church only from 1801 gradually adapted to the needs of the episcopal residence and the Eastern liturgy. In the bishop's residence, which is part of the magnificent church, there is a particularly valuable library of Greek Catholic bishops where incunabulas have recently been found (very rare and valuable copies of books that were not handwritten, but mechanically printed before 1501 in Europe). Library holds the first printed Bible in the Croatian language by Petar Katančić, printed in 1831 in Buda. About five thousand valuable books are kept in the library, and the oldest ones date back to the 15th century. The church changed its external and internal appearance in 1895-1897 receiving the stylistic characteristics of the neo-Gothic according to the ideas of the famous architect Herman Bolle, who also remodeled the Zagreb Cathedral. It was painted by our greatest painters from the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century (Bela Čikoš Sesija, Ivan Tišov, Ferdo Kovačević, Celestin Mato Medović and others). Chapel of St. Florijan Baroque building, built in the suburbs of the Lower Town, at the junction of the access road from Zagreb with the network of city streets. It is located in front of today's post office building. Chapel of St. Florijan is the most artistically valuable of the three baroque chapels in Križevci, and was built as a vow in 1735 after a fire. It was rebuilt in 1751. It was destroyed again in another great fire in 1775. It was restored at the end of the 18th century. At the door of the chapel of St. Florian, firefighters from voluntary societies bring flowers on the day of their patron saint. Church of Our Blessed Virgin Mary of Sorrow and St. Marko A masterpiece of Baroque architecture, a central three-leafed building with a dome. The church holds valuable examples of chalices, medallions, eternal light that testify to the rites of worship. In 1702, the parish priest of Križevci, Juraj Janković, built a smaller chapel at the crossroads of the present church, and in 1715, a three-nave nave and a smaller side one-nave space were added. Two altars were placed in the nave: the Holy Trinity and the Holy Three Kings, which are still in the left and right apses. Ten years later, the Paulines upgraded the apse parts of the church: three internally circular apse extensions and a dome above the crossroads. Church of St. Mary of Carinthia is important for Croatian architecture precisely because a three-leaf base plan appears in its sanctuary for the first time. The dome and the apsidal parts were painted in 1726. In the same year, the side space on the right side of the nave of the church was increased by two aisles, thus completely closing one outer wall of the nave. The high bell tower with a yoke in which the choir was built was added in 1872. This addition nullified the architectural emphasis on the dominant dome, below which is Altenbach's statue of Our Lady of Sorrows. In 2004, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Cardinal Josip Bozanić, founded a new parish of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. Marko Križevčanin and then the parish church of the Mother of God of Carinthia became its parish church. During 2006, the church was completely renovated. At the end of the last or the beginning of this century, the vaults of the nave and the sacristy were decorated by a local painter.

96,Križevci,Tradition,"Križevci Statutes Long known has been the great hospitality of local people towards all guests who come with honest intentions. Križevci is one of the oldest towns in the northern part of Croatia and its citizens are always in the forefront with their hospitality which is always gladly talked about. Our people are easily finding reasons for having fun, breaking the monotony of everyday life, and are always in the company of happy friends and in a way that will remain in everyone's memory. This is exactly what the Križevci Statutes are based on - a set of unique rules and regulations of behavior in merry societies with various wine festivities. Because, in order to respect everything at public festivities, not to insult anyone and not to be drunk, there were the Križevci statutes, the only written rules of good manners at the table, which have been mentioned since the 18th century, and without which the fun and merriment was hard to imagine. In addition, the Statutes have patriotic, sociological and literary value, which stems from the fact that, according to the Statutes, three toasts must be held in every society: ""a toast to the homeland, friends and the fairer sex"", in the old way of speaking."
96,Križevci,Bilikum,"The name bilikum comes from the German word willkommen. Bilikum was any vessel from which a toast was drunk in honor of coming to someone's house. The most famous are bilikums in three parts (the word trilikum, which people associate with a three-part vessel, is an incorrect name and means nothing), but bilikum could have been the most common purchase. Drinking bilikum was a very important act and as such was immediately entered into the house protocol. It was a book in which everything was recorded, from information about who drank bilikum and thus became a family friend, to other important information such as the birth, marriage or death of a family member, but also how he gave birth on the farm, what it was like harvest, how much must was obtained and the like. The house protocol was the most important book in every house and was kept in a special place, usually under lock and key. Great Križevci Spravišče Spravišče is traditional folk festival and cultural-historical event that has been held every June since 1968. It is based on the legend that speaks of the reconciliation of Križevci citizens and Kalnik plums nobles and on the Križevci statutes, the popular wine ceremony and the first written rules of conduct in cheerful company and at a full table. Legend dating back to the 13th century has it that the Croatian-Hungarian king Bela IV took refuge in the old town of Kalnik to hide from invading Mongol armies. Due to the high walls of Kalnik castle and the lack of adequate weapons, the Mongols could not reach the king. Kalnik peasants who were hiding him, thought of starving them to surrender. However, as plums grew along Kalnik, the peasants began to feed the king with plums. Mongol armies eventually lost patience and withdrew, making Kalnik the only city that the fierce invaders did not conquer. As a token of gratitude, the king conferred noble titles on the peasants, and yet, having saved the king, were in a more favorable position. The people of Križevci were extremely jealous of the noble titles for Kalnik peasants, and have mockingly called the Kalnik peasants ‘noble Kalnik plum growers'. The legend goes on to say that this is when the quarrel between Upper and Lower city began, which lasted until a young man from Kalnik fell in love with a girl from the town. As love prevailed, before the wedding they had to reconcile and ‘put something together'. The people of Kalnik brought wine and plum brandy to the festival of reconciliation, since they were ‘plum growers', and the citizens prepared an ox, which is traditionally roasted on Spravišče today, so they all rejoiced, ate and drank for three days. Križevci female guard The only female historical unit in the world that has its roots in July 1848, when Ban Josip Jelačić was guarded by girls from Križevci, a native of Križevci who stood at the entrance to the bishop's court. They stood conscious of their duty at the door, and in their gentle hands gleamed a deadly weapon. The Križevci Girl's Guard successfully represents Križevci by participating in numerous events across the country and abroad."

Njegov kaštel je tijekom burne povijesti porušen. Nekoć se nalazio na samoj obali jezera koji je po njemu i dobio ime Čepićko jezero. Jezero je bilo široko 2,5 km i dugo 4 km, a nastalo je na mjestu gdje je rijeka Boljunčica u ledenom dobu nanosima začepila prirodni ponor i polje pretvorila u jezero. Jezero je bilo bogato ribom, posebno jeguljama i rakovima i ptičjim vrstama (divlja patka, bijela roda, labudovi). Žitelji su se bavili slatkovodnim ribolovom, a u to se vrijeme u ondašnjim gostionicama moglo kušati jela od morske, ali i slatkovodne ribe. No, zbog prisustva malaričnih komaraca i čestih poplava, jezero je isušeno za vrijeme dominacije fašističke Italije u Istri 1932. i pretvoreno u žitna polja kako bi se osigurala hrana za mnogoljudnu vojsku. Prokopan je kanal kojim je sva voda preusmjerena u more Plominskog zaljeva, a površina jezera postupno je pretvorena u obradive površine. Danas se u Čepiću nalaze župna crkva Presvetog Trojstva iz 19. stoljeća s kamenim i drvenim kipovima svetaca i crkva Svetog Justa iz 13. stoljeća. U njoj se ističe nadgrobna ploča s glagoljskim natpisom koja potječe iz nekadašnje crkve Gospe od jezera. Crkva se nalazila u sklopu obližnjeg augustinskog, a zatim pavlinskog samostana Blažene Djevice Marije koji je bio najstariji takav samostan u Istri. Godine 1782. redovnici ga napuštaju i odlaze u Novi Vinodolski i Crikvenicu. Do danas je sačuvano arhitektonsko zdanje samostana koje okružuje dvorište s bunarom u sredini. U njemu su danas nastanjeni lokalni stanovnici. Kaštel Kršan - the guardian of the Istrian Book of Boundaries The elevation near a large field is the site of Kršan''s tower, the remnant of the medieval castle. A little town, today''s Kršan, developed around the tower as the centre of the municipality bearing the same name. The elevation near a large field is the site of Kršan''s tower, the remnant of the medieval castle. A little town, today''s Kršan, developed around the tower as the centre of the municipality bearing the same name. It was mentioned for the first time in 1274 as Castrum Carsach, the tower destroyed by the army of the Count of Gorica Albert II. At that time, the Patriarch of Aquileia ruled Kršan. At the beginning of the 14th century, Henry of Pazin-Pisino became the owner of one half of Kršan. He was the descendant of the noble family Kerstlein from Pazin-Pisino after which the castle and the little town of Kršan were named. The tip of the arrow on Henry''s coat of arms is still used as the coat of arms of the Municipality of Kršan. The last owner of this beautiful and impressive castle was the noble family Tonetti from Plomin. Several other noblemen also originate from Kaštel. In the Middle Ages, they filled important posts in the Pazin-Pisino County. The best-known nobleman is Andrija of Kršan, Captain of Pazin-Pisino from 1488 to 1500. His tombstone with the family coat of arms is now situated in the chapel of St. Henry in Belaj where it had been transferred from the tomb in the church of a former Paulist monastery on the shore of the Lake of Čepić. In the 19th century, a transcript of Istarski razvod (The Istrian Book of Boundaries) was found in Kršan. It was made by the priest from Barban Jakov Križanić. This important historic and legal document was published in 1852 by Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, and it was transcribed in Latin script and prepared for print by Dr. Ante Starčević, later a prominent Croatian politician. Only a four-sided tower has been preserved of the old castle. Later on, defensive and residential buildings were erected around the tower. You could enter the castle using a stairway located in the entryway connected with the covered courtyard with a cistern in its centre. The courtyard was later opened towards the town following the opening of a door. Together with the dominant tower, the complex of the castle in Kršan consists of several rooms for the staff and the weapons, a large building used as residence of estate owners and a large separate kitchen."
98,Kršan,Jasenovik,"Šušnjevica, Jasenovik, Letaj, pa još i Brdo i Nova Vas, mjesta su podno obronaka planine Učke. Stanovništvo se pretežito bavi poljoprivredom i raznim obrtima, ali i razvija zanimljivu turističku ponudu. U okolici postoje prapovijesni i nalazi iz rimskog doba. Jasenovik u kojemu živi tek 57 stanovnika može se podičiti romaničkom crkvom Sv. Kvirina čije je freske oslikao majstor Albert iz 1461. Na području Nove Vasi je crkva Sv. Duha koju je oslikao majstor Blaž Dubrovčanin čiji likovi kronološki pripadaju 16. stoljeću. U slikovitom Letaju je u 16. stoljeću izgrađena crkvica Sv.Jakova, a od 11. pa do 17. stoljeća i na njegovom području postojala je utvrda - kaštel. Šušnjevica se prvi puta spominje 1340., a 1838. izgrađena je crkva Sv. Ivana Krstitelja na mjestu starije jednobrodne. Na groblju je kapela posvećena Sv. Silvestru, papi iz 16. stoljeća, a vidljivi su ostaci fresaka i glagoljaških grafita. Šušnjevica je i središte govornika vlaškog jezika. Kožljak Na zapadnim padinama Učke, uz Čepićko polje, nalazi se naselje Kožljak. Poljoprivreda i stočarstvo važne su grane privrede, a naselje čine srednjovjekovni kaštel i u blizini podignut novi dio. Danas napušteni kaštel, koji se obnavlja, nastao je na mjestu ilirske gradine, a prvi put se spominje 1102. godine. Smješten je na strmoj litici, vjerojatno za potrebe nadzora puta koji je još od prapovijesti, zatim rimskog doba i srednjeg vijeka, vodio iz središnje Istre prema Kvarneru. Kaštel se sastojao od stambenih i gospodarskih zgrada, a bio je okružen zidinama i kulom. Značaj je izgubio krajem 17. stoljeća. Unutar zidina nalaze se ostaci romaničke župne crkve Sv. Hadrijana, proširene 1834. godine, a u blizini se pruža upečatljiv pogled na Čepićko polje. U crkvi se inače nalazi i ploča s glagoljskim natpisom iz 1590. a izvan nje nalaze se još dvije kapele. Kaštel je pripadao austrijskom dijelu Istre, na samoj granici s mletačkim dijelom. Kao i kaštel Kršan, i Kožljak je imao neobične vladare. Najpoznatiji bili su oholi i okrutni grof Nikolić, kojega su pobunjeni podanici u 16. st. ubili te uskočka obitelj Mojsijević za vrijeme čijeg vladanja je Kožljak bio najrazvijeniji. Kaštel Kožljak i obitelj Barbo, pripadnici starog mletačkog patricijskog roda i jedni od vlasnika s kraja 16. i početka 17. st., ostavili su značajan trag zbog jedne nepobitne povijesne činjenice. Naime, u doba protestantizma, postao je bedem reformacije u Istri. Franjo Barbo od Kožljaka je napravio središte protestantizma, ali i glagoljske kulturne tradicije. Posjedovao je najveću biblioteku protestantskih knjiga koje su rasparčavali širom Istre, kako je svojedobno zapisala inkvizicija. Unutar kaštela mala je crkvica posvećena Svetom Hadrijanu, prvobitno manja romanička kapela, a poslije župna crkva, znatno produžena 1834. Kršan Naselje i središte općine nastalo je uz srednjovjekovni kaštel, danas jedan od najbolje očuvanih istarskih kaštela, a leži uz jugozapadni rub Čepićkog polja. Noviji dio naselja smješten je na raskrižju cesta prema Labinu, a preko tunela Učka, prema Rijeci. Kroz burnu povijest, kršanski kaštel je imao je mnoge vladare i gospodare, a samim tim i bogatu povijest. Kršanski kaštel se inače prvi put spominje 1274. godine kao Castrum Carsach i to samo 40 godina nakon spominjanja Berlina, na primjer. Do navedene godine bio je pod upravom akvilejskih patrijarha, a od tada potpada pod vlast Pazinske Knežije (austrijski dio Istre u srednjem i novom vijeku). Današnje ime, pretpostavlja se, dobio je po vlasnicima iz 15. stoljeća, obitelji Cherstlein de Pisino koja se u to vrijeme počinje nazivati von Karscheyner. U obiteljskom grbu istaknut je vrh strijele, a motiv je preuzela i današnja kršanska općina. Po njima kaštel dobiva naziv Kršan, no, postoji još jedno tumačenje porijekla naziva naselja koji, možda, potječe od krševitog terena na kojemu je smješten Stari grad. Tijekom vrlo burne povijesti kaštelom Kršan gospodarili su brojni vlasnici. Ovdje je zanimljivosti radi potrebno istaknuti dvojicu. Jedan od njih, feudalac Juraj Karscheyner iz Kršana bio je bogati stanovnik kaštela s kraja 16. stoljeća, ali i ozloglašeni razbojnik koji je pod zastavom Austrije pljačkao mletačke posjede. Kršan se tada nalazio na pograničnom području između Austrije i Venecije, a zbog njegovih zlodjela, osigurana je nagrada od čak 1000 dukata za njegovu glavu. Juraj biva konačno uhićen i odveden u Kopar gdje su ga Mlečani osudili na smrt utapljanjem. Zanimljiv je i posljednji vlasnik kršanskog kaštela, grof Giuseppe Tonetti iz Plomina s početka 20. stoljeća. Nazvan je «crveni grof» s obzirom na to da je po uvjerenju bio ljevičar i otvoreno pomagao organizirani ustanak labinskih rudara koji su se 1921. godine prvi u Europi podigli protiv ondašnje talijanske fašističke represije i osnovali kratkotrajnu Labinsku Republiku. Zbog toga je tijekom Drugog svjetskog rata «crveni grof» bio u zatvoru, a pod vrlo čudnim okolnostima izgorio je njegov kršanski kaštel 1940. Istraga je pokazala da je požar uzrokovala zapaljena drvena greda uz peć, a snažna bura pridonijela je da vatra u času proguta unutrašnjost građevine: namještaj, knjižnicu, vrijedne slike i obiteljsku arhivu. Nedavni početak revitalizacije i obnove kaštela nagovještava da će zdanje postati centar kulturnih događanja i raznih manifestacija. Zaštitnik općine Kršan je Sv. Jakov, a njegova crkva nalazi se na mjesnom groblju. Prilikom obnove 1991. godine pronađena su i dva natpisa na glagoljici, prvom slavenskom pismu. Zahvaljujući važnom prometnom položaju prema Rijeci, Trstu i Pazinu, u desetljeću od 1850. do 1950., Kršan dobiva poštu, pekaru, nekoliko gostionica, trgovine, benzinsku crpku, mehaničarsku radnju, mlin i sve drugo što jedan gradić treba imati. Njegovi žitelji zaposleni su i u rudnicima boksita, u plominskoj luci te na obližnjim poljima. Među njima bilo je i vrsnih pomoraca i lučkih radnika, a i onih koji su prevozili drvo za ogrjev preko plominske luke. Kršan danas vrlo uspješno razvija poduzetništvo, poljoprivredu i stočarstvo, a postaje i prepoznatljiva turistička destinacija s brojnim kućama za odmor i zanimljivim manifestacijama kao što su Festival samoniklog bilja, Krafifest, Kršonski pir, Dani istarskog zvončića, Festival lova - Hubertfest i dr. Kršanski stari grad Kršanski stari grad je utvrđeni grad i jedan je od najbolje očuvanih istarskih kaštela koji se prvi puta spominje u 13. stoljeću. Nalazi se na uzvisini koju ovalno okružuju obrambeni zidovi. U grad se ulazi kroz dobro očuvana gradska vrata, a maleno dvorište okružuju ostaci stambenih i gospodarskih građevina. S desne strane, na obrambeni zid prva se naslanja stara općinska kuća. Nasuprot nje, nalazi se kaštel koji je dijelom izgrađen na strmoj kamenoj stijeni, a obrambeni sklop kaštela je trapeznog tlocrta, a čini ga visoka kula koja dominira cijelim naseljem. U malom unutrašnjem dvorištu, sačuvan je i okvir gotičkog portala iz 15. st. te bunarsko grlo s uklesanom godinom izgradnje, 1666. Nasuprot kaštelu, a unutar obrambenih zidova uzdiže se dvobrodna župna crkva Sv. Antona opata iz 17. st. koja je u 18. st. obnovljena u baroknom stilu s očuvanim kamenim oltarom i mramornim inkrustacijama, mramornom krstionicom, umivaonikom i srebrnim kaležom . Na podu se nalazi nadgrobna ploča iz 17. st. Godine 1803. podignut je samostojeći zvonik visok 22 metra, a početkom prošlog stoljeća crkva dobiva i orgulje. Izvana, na groblju, nalazi se i kapela Sv.Jakova iz 15. st. dograđena 1814., na čijem su podu nadgrobne ploče feudalnih gospodara iz 15., 16. i 17. st. Ističe se ploča iz 1415. Julija Kršanskog gdje je latinski epitaf ispisan gotičkim slovima."

98,Kršan,Plomin,"Kad se govori o kulturi, baštini i povijesti na području općine Kršan, nemoguće je izostaviti Plomin, jedno od najstarijih istarskih naselja uopće. Antička Phlanona, talijanska Fianona, još je jedan utvrđeni gradić, opasan srednjovjekovnim bedemima iz 13. i 14. stoljeća te renesansnim obrambenim zidovima iz 16. i 17. stoljeća. Smješten je u podnožju istoimene Plominske gore, na uzvisini od 168 m iznad Plominskog zaljeva i drage. S jedne strane pogled seže prema Velim vratima na Kvarneru, otoku Cresu i Rijeci, a s druge prema istarskom kopnu. Plomin je nastao na mjestu prapovijesne gradine iz 2. tisućljeća p.n.e., a njime su u 1. tisućljeću p.n.e. gospodarili Liburni (ilirski narod koji je nastanjivao istočnu obalu Istre) Za vrijeme antike, nakon što je potpao pod rimsku vlast, postao je još značajnija luka I trgovačko središte. Plomin je bio najisturenija zapadna točka antičke provincije Dalmacije. Nakon pada zapadnog rimskog carstva, promijenio je nekoliko vladara - Istočni Goti, Bizant i Langobardi, a od 788. bili su to Franci. U vrijeme Mlečana bio je i najizloženija mletačka utvrda na istočnoj obali Istre, a teško je stradavao u mletačko - austrijskim sukobima u 16. i 17. stoljeću. Između svjetskih ratova bio je u sklopu fašističke Italije, a kraj Drugog svjetskog rata dočekao je gotovo opustošen. Iako danas u Plominu živi tek stotinjak stanovnika, bogata prošlost i blizina prirodnih znamenitosti utječu na sve veći posjet gostiju i razvoj turističkih kapaciteta. U Plominu su danas sačuvana sjeverna vrata kroz koja se ulazilo u grad. Župna crkva Bl. Djevice Marije iz 15. stoljeća mjesto je gdje se može vidjeti zanimljivo gotičko raspelo te značajnu fresku Bogorodice hraniteljice, kamenu kustodiju iz 1499., drvene kipove Sv. Antuna Pustinjaka, Majke Božje s djetetom i Sv. Roka i renesansne korske klupe i tzv. zlatni oltar iz 17. stoljeća. Otkrivena je i velika zidna freska slikara Alberta iz Kostanza koju je naslikao 1475. Na gradskom trgu nalazi se komunalna palača La Tura. Otuda kreće mreža malih i uskih uličica koje isprepliću kamene zgrade za koje se čini kao da izranjaju iz stijena. Plomin krase renesansne i barokne zgrade-palače, a koliko je mjesto staro govori i zapis Artemidora iz drevnog Efeza koji ga u svojim spisima spominje već 100. godine p.n.e. kao Flánon. Impresivno! Od ostalih građevina, ističe se romanička crkva Sv. Jurja iz 11. stoljeća, prva plominska župna crkva kojom dominira romanički zvonik visok 15 m, jedan od tri romanička zvonika sačuvana u Istri. Crkva je nadaleko poznata po Plominskoj ploči iz 11. stoljeća, uzidanoj na vanjskom zidu. Plominski natpis je kamena ploča s reljefnim prikazom ilirsko- rimskog boga Silvana - drevnog zaštitnika flore i faune te naknadno dodanim glagoljskim natpisom. Moguće je da je crkva nastala na mjestu nekadašnjeg ilirskog hrama. Glagoljski natpis na reljefu je jedan od najstarijih pronađenih glagoljskih natpisa uopće. Reljef je jedan od najstarijih materijalnih i pisanih dokumenata o prisustvu Slavena na ovim prostorima, a zbog povijesne vrijednosti, reljef je 1971. godine bio izložen i u Parizu na izložbi Umjetnost na tlu Jugoslavije, a nakon toga pohranjen je u Zagrebu. Pročelje crkvice danas ima njegov otisak. Natpis sadrži oblu glagoljicu koja je u Hrvatskoj korištena prije uglate, a ovaj plominski natpis, za kojega se pretpostavlja da je stariji i od Baščanske i Valunske ploče ili Krčkog natpisa, ubrajamo u najstarije spomenike hrvatskog jezika. U crkvi se ističe i raspelo iz 13. stoljeća. Zanimljivo je da je Sveti Juraj uzeo pod svoju zaštitu proljeće, usjeve ali i konjanike. Vjerojatno je zbog toga Plominu podario i rajski istarski zvončić. Crkvu Svetog Jurja značajno je spomenuti i zbog zavjetnih darova plominskih pomoraca koji su se ovdje skrušeno molili za zaštitu i blagostanje. Ipak je to grad pomoraca i brodovlasnika."
98,Kršan,Plomin Luka,"U podnožju Plomina na samom kraju Plominskog zaljeva, uz nekadašnju plodnu dolinu, smjestilo se naselje Plomin Luka. Razvojni put Plomina i Plomin Luke je dug i nerazdvojiv. Plominski zaljev imao je važno strateško i prometno značenje još u vrijeme grčke antike, a spominje ga se, kao i Plomin, 100. godine p.n.e. pod imenom Kólpos flanatikòs. Zaljev ima oblik fjorda. Dug je oko 4 km a širok najviše 400 m. Usječen je u kopno iznad kojega se dižu gore i odličan je prirodni štit od vjetra i nevera koje na moru znaju biti kobne, osobito na Kvarneru. Naselje je oduvijek živjelo kao trgovačka i ribarska luka značajna za izvoz boksita, a spojena željezničkom prugom s rudnikom u Šumberu. Tome svjedoči i uređena obala, ali i zanimljivost da je Plomin Luka nekoć imala i Lučku kapetaniju. Plomin Luka je sve do kraja Drugog svjetskog rata bila prometno važno odredište odakle se redovitom trajektnom vezom moglo putovati do Rijeke, Cresa i Lošinja. U gradiću su živjeli brojni pomorci, ribari i mlinari, a napuštanje naselja započelo je nakon kapitulacije Italije 1943. godine. Izgradnjom dviju termoelektrana, prve 1969., a druge 2000., u naselje se vraća život. Uz termoelektrane koje proizvode oko 12% sveukupnih hrvatskih godišnjih potreba električne energije, izgrađen je i dimnjak visok 340 metara, što je najviša građevina u Hrvatskoj. Poštujući sve blagodati suvremene tehnologije na području zaštite okoliša, ostavljeno je prostora i za razvoj turističkih smještajnih kapaciteta s kvalitetnom kulinarskom ponudom i izletništvom. Danas je Plomin Luka i dalje ribarska luka u koju rado zalaze i nautičari. Potpićan"

Park prirode obuhvaća istoimenu planinu i dio područja Ćićarije, sveukupne površine od 160 kvadratnih kilometara. Neposredna blizina mora kao i sam reljef Učke uvjetovali su razvoj specifične klime i bujne vegetacije, a to je dovelo do stvaranja parka prirode. Učka je proglašena zaštićenim područjem u travnju 1999. godine. Bogata livadna i druga antropogena staništa Učke kriju brojne endemske, ugrožene i zaštićene biljne i životinjske vrste. Na području parka očuvana je endemska biljka učkarski zvončić, a moguće je vidjeti i rijetke ptice poput bjeloglavog supa i surog orla. Najveći je Učke prekriven je bukovom šumom, s nešto crnoga graba, hrasta te crnoga bora, dok su gospodarski posebno važni nasadi pitomoga kestena.

It is truly diverse from an architectural point of view as it was built and rebuilt in various eras, and each of them gave its own special characteristics to this extraordinarily valuable edifice. Also, the Old Town lays on a strategic point, next to the Kupa River which has always been an important communication. And, like for every other castle, there are also legends connected to Stari Grad Ozalj. One such story tells us about old tunnels which were used as escape passageways. Another goes in 17thcentury: during some construction works in a castle courtyard, a landslide occurred and opened a forgotten cellar, in which a lot of treasure and a royal crown was found.

Its historicist architectural appearance, like a Neo-Renaissance castle, owes to the famous Austrian architect Hermann Bolle. After the introduction of electric current, Karlovac was the second city in Croatia with public electricity lighting, while the first was Šibenik 1895. In the beginning, ""Munjara"" was used only for the public lighting, and consumption was free."

On the ruins of the Roman building, an early medieval settlement with a small church was built, which has not been preserved. What is interesting is that the church service was conducted there until the last century, and the community kept an oil lamp burning night and day as a symbol of faith and a benevolent sign to ships. There is a Šišan folk song that is based on this fact:"

In the old days, there was an old linden next to the nettle tree. Today, only the nettle tree remains standing. During local religious missions in 1867, a large stone cross was erected there and still stands. In the old days, just as today, old men used to sit on the stone wall in the shade of the old linden and nettle tree. Only their clothes were different, with traditional jackets made of rough domestic cloth slung over their shoulders. They wore white skintight cloth trousers and a small folk cap on their heads, and smoked clay pipes.

It developed on the site of a Roman farm. The name of the village is first mentioned in 1150 (vicus Castaneus). From the 12th to the 16th century, it was one of the largest and most important villages in the Pula area. In the 16th century, many settlements in that area, including Kostanjica, were deserted due to plague, malaria and famine. Kostanjica was abandoned around 1585, and the remaining inhabitants moved to Muntić. Today, only the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is preserved. It belongs to the Parish of Muntić, to which it was annexed after its last surviving inhabitants moved there. Dr. sc. Milena Joksimović The Italian warship ""Cesare Rossarol"" The Italian warship ""Cesare Rossarol"" was built during the period from 1913 to 1914 in the shipyard ""Giovanni Ansaldo"" in the city of Sestri Ponente near Genova (Italiy). It belonged to the class of light exploration ships. The purpose of such ships was to patrol, escort and protect larger armoured warships, lay mines, fight smaller warships and aircrafts. ""Cesare Rossarol"" became part of the Italian Navy on 1 February 1915 and she conducted combat tasks along the whole Adriatic Sea. In the last days of World War II (4 November 1918) the ship sailed from the south to the north Adriatic. At the admiral Umberto Cagnia's command, on 16 November 1918 at 11:40 the ""Cesare Rossarol"" sailed out from Pula to Rijeka as a support to the Italian troupes which were part of the San Marco battalion. At 12:45 sharp the ship struck an underwater anchored mine and the powerful explosion broke her into two parts. The stern and bow of the ship soon sank to the depth of 50 meters, and they were about 300 meters distant from each other. There were 36 crew members who survived and the north-east wind blew them to the Munat Veliki cape. At about 7:30 p.m. they were transferred to the Tegetthof military barracks in Pula, while those who were more seriously injured were transferred to the naval hospital in Pula. The warship ""Cesare Rossarol"" was officially cancelled from the fleet by a decree dated 23 January 1919. To remember the huge naval tragedy which befell the warship ""Cesare Rossarol"", the bereaved families raised a monument which was unveiled on 10 November 1919. Monte Madonna, Sissano Monte Madonna had a function as a shelter of the Kvarner Bay, so that it is also called "" Guard of the Kvarner"". Its role was to shelter the main military harbour Pula and to control the Kvarner. The highest altitude is at 88 m above sea level, whereas the military base is at 30 m below the mountain surface. After the withdrawal of  Austria-Hungary, after 1918, the place has consecutively been used by Italian, German, Yugoslav and Croatian army. During the use by the Yugoslav National Army, an underground site was built with a dormitory for 24 soldiers, a light station, which covered half of the Kvarner Bay, 4 artillery batallions, a department of computer command, an ambulance, a command shelter, and an observatory at a 20 -meter height reached by steep spiral stairs. Church of St. Jeronimo, Muntić There is more available information about the church from the 14th century at the time of its renovation. At the time, the church had valuable inventory and old stone slabs with inscriptions in ancient Gothic and Glagolitic script. However, there's no trace of the slabs today. The church walls used to be decorated with frescoes. The frescoes disappeared during the last reconstruction, which was carried out without a restorer. There are two bells in the belfry. One of the bells, from 1396, was made in the workshop of Marco Vendramo in Venice. Near the church there is a large medieval well that provided many generations with water. Source: www.istrapedia.hr Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary/Kostanjica, Valtura Early Christian martyr St. Germanus was killed at the time when the Western Roman Empire was ruled by the cruel Emperor Karin. By order of the Emperor, the local head Antonin initiated the persecution of Christians. Germanus was a 32-year-old deacon in Pula. He spent his days fasting and praying and helping the poor. In a dream, Germanus received an order to oppose Antonin. This is why he was tortured in the Pula Arena and finally executed on the way from Pula to Nesactium in May 284. His body was secretly buried at night on the site where, according to oral tradition, a church dedicated to St. Germanus was built, later dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The church is single-nave; it has a semicircular apse and a belfry in the shape of a distaff. An upside-down Gothic inscription mentioning St. Mary and Kostanjica is built into the facade. Inside the church there are consecrated crosses on the walls, painted at the time of the first consecration of the church, probably in the 14th century, and the fresco of St. Bartholomew. Graffiti of ships and riders are engraved in the frescoes. The church preserves valuable wooden statues from the 15th century. Source: Milena Joksimović, PhD Holy Trinity Church in Šišan- mid-15th century A small Holy Trinity Church was built at the time when Šišan was a rich and important place. The church is a single-nave, which means its interior is not divided by columns or walls. The keystone displays the relief of the Crucifix with Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist at the base. The church was probably completely painted. Master builders constructed the church with evenly chiseled stones and panels with delicate reliefs of crosses. One stone displays a medaillon with a carved cross and two tiny trees- an old Christian symbol of Christ (cross) and paradise (trees displayed under the crossbar of the cross). In the 16th century there was a  nice wooden crucifix of  Jesus, which is today in the parish church. The priest held the mass in the square-plan apse, which has its own pointed vaulting, on the altar, whose base consists of split pieces of an antique coffin. This is not rare- the altars in Istria have very often inserted fragments of antique sculptures. It symbolises the victory of Christianity over paganism. Church of St. Felix and Fortunato, Šišan The single-nave parish church of St. Felix and Fortunato was built in 1528 on the site of an older church. It preserves valuable inventory: the Gothic Virgin Mary with Child, from the end of the 15th century, the work of the so-called Master of the Labin Madonna, a Baroque marble main altar with statues of patron saints, a wooden gilded sanctuary with painted doors, the Virgin with the Child (from around 1480) from the ruined Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary on Svetica hill southeast of Šišan, a late Gothic wooden crucifix from the Church of St. Trinity (16th century) and a sarcophagus with the relics of St. Lawrence. The bell tower in front of the church was renovated in 1659. The Church of Sv. Trinity from 1450 is single-nave with an inscribed apse. It has a consecrated cross with a Glagolitic grafitti inscription. Source: R. Matijašić, Ageri antičkih kolonija Pola-Parentium (Agers of Ancient Colonies Pola - Parentium), Zagreb 1988; Ž.

In the Church of Our Lady of Kuj there is a glass floor, covering a mosaic from the late-antique villa rustica. The current appearance of the church is typical of simple Baroque architecture. This common type of church building, like most rural churches in Istria and along our coast in general, reflects the spirit of provincial possibilities and understanding of the time. It has an irregular rectangular plan, with a shallow irregular rectangular apse, which is also a sacristy. Church of Our Lady of Mercy, Ližnjan The church is located at the main intersection of the village. It was built in the early 18th century. It has a stone altar. In the past, the altar used to have a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary. It has a small belfry with a bell. The church is closed, no ceremonies are held in it, but it opens occasionally during the main season to host exhibitions of paintings by local painters. Church of St. Martin the Blessed, Ližnjan The Parish Church of St. Martin is a three-nave building of the neo-Romanesque style. It is located in the old town of Ližnjan. It was built in 1879 on the site of a smaller church that had been demolished two years before the construction of the today's big church began. There is valuable inventory in the church. On the main altar there is a wooden statue of St. Martin. In addition to the main altar there are four more altars, all made from stone with an elevated sanctuary. The church bell tower is 30 metres tall. Church of St. John the Apostle, Valtura The Church of St. John the Apostle from the 19th century is located in Valtura.

Istriot dialect of Šišan The Istriot dialect of Šišan, as well as that of Rovinj, Vodnjan, Bale, Fažana and Galižana, represents the last remnant of the pre-Venetian Romanesque layer in Istria. The Istriot language is a Romance language. It has been preserved in southern Istria between Rovinj and Šišan, in the Romanesque-Slavic area. The speakers distinguish the Istriot dialects from the Istrian-Venetian dialects and the Croatian population calls the speakers of the Istriot dialect Latins. Although there are differences between individual dialects, their origin is undoubtedly the same and they represent the last aspect of the Istrian Romanesque culture. The Istriot autochthonous pre-Venetian Romance language of southwestern Istria is included in the list of the 24 most endangered European languages. It is critically endangered and on the verge of extinction because it is mainly used by older speakers. The young Italian population understands most of it, but does not use it. Therefore, the Italian Community of Šišan has taken many active steps to preserve the language like the Festival dell'istrioto, which takes place every year in the autumn. https://www.festivalistrioto.com/ Martinja (St. Martin, 11 November) One of the main processions is held in Ližnjan on the day of St. Martin, because this saint is the patron saint of the parish. A fair is held on that day, when merchants used to come to the square (Placa) to sell various goods. Even today, people from the surrounding villages and relatives come together on that day, a dance is held as well. Women would make a wheel-shaped cake made of yeast dough - decorated with zigzag incisions. In the morning, they would prepare žbruvada (sour cabbage), as well as mutton soup and stew. Each house received a lot of guests, and when leaving everyone would get a cake tucked in their hand. People enjoyed the wine that had matured in that period, they used to say: Kad se vrže između dva dna, da se gleda otkud se ga da! (When you put the wine between two bottoms, you have to be able to see through it)."
111,Ližnjan Tourist Board,Mantinjade-Mantignade,"Šišan's mantinjade - mantignade Sissanesi are traditional tunes performed primarily during the carnival festivities. They are, in fact, a series of verses intertwined with a mixture of Italian, Venetian and Istriot dialects, and the melody is based on the Istrian scale. Some people from Šišan used to sing them a little differently, they followed the melody and pauses reminiscent of the ""thin and thick"" singing style, which points to the Slavic origin of mantinjade introduced into Šišan's tradition by the new inhabitants from the interior of Istria who had settled here centuries ago. They brought along a rich folklore tradition that they were proud of and that was quickly assimilated by the new environment. These people embraced the local tradition and the Istriot dialect, and left their mark on these tunes that became indigenous over time and have continued to change to this day. However, their true origin is not yet known and is shrouded in mystery. Šišan's mantinjade differ from the folk songs of other Romance-speaking settlements in Istria, they are rich with clear overtones of multiculturalism, bilingualism and the community. In 2009, mantinjade, together with the two-part singing in the Istrian scale, in Istria and the Croatian Littoral, as well as all other traditional tunes of Istrian Italians and Istro-Romanians, were included in the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage. In 2015, in collaboration with the piano teacher Ana Debeljuh, the Italian Community of Šišan released a CD with mantinjade recorded that year, but which also included those recorded in 1983. Pust (Carnival) Today's customs begin with the takeover of municipal power by a masquerade group. The mayor hands over the ""key"" to the municipality and thus symbolically marks the rule of the masquerade. The Ližnjan's Masquerade Association strives to maintain the tradition of visiting the village in a masked procession composed of people of all ages. Locals give sausages and eggs to masquerade groups, and sweets to the little ones. On Shrove Tuesday, in the social hall of the Municipality of Ližnjan, a frittata with sausages is prepared, followed by šentenca (sentencing), the reading of the verdict and, consequently, the burning of the Pust. After the burning, the carnival festivities with a music programme continue until late at night."
111,Ližnjan Tourist Board,Places,"Ližnjan Ližnjan is a small fishing village with a natural protected harbour situated on a small peninsula on the very south of Istria. The place has a magnificent view of crystal clear sea and the Kvarner islands of extraordinary beauty. There are around 28 km of beautiful unspoiled beaches, which are mostly rocky. The picturesque harbour will tell you that you are in a place that since ancient times has relied on underwater life. The underwater along the Marlera coast and partly the area of Kuje Bay will unveil one of the last flourishing meadows of sea grass or Voga. Aside from the common inhabitants of the Adriatic Sea, the Ližnjan underwater is home to a sunk italian cruiser ""Cesare Rossol"", which attracts numerous divers. The light scout cruiser, which sunk on 16 November 1918 after it had hit a mine, is 85 m long and 8 m wide. Also, in the Ližnjan underwater you can discover antique ships sunk in the midst of a storm. This hidden place of natural beauty, clean sea and indented coast will enchant every traveller by the beauty of rocks and pebbles. A characteristic feature of the fauna is the bird bee-eater, an endemic protected species which inhabits its natural habitat on the island of Marlera in the summer. Šišan Jadreški Jadreški ( Italian Giadreschi), a settlement 5 km north-east from Pula, south of the Pula airport. It was founded by the fugitive settlers from the hinterland of Zadar ( ladera), at the end of the 16th century. In 1580 even fugitives from Cyprus settled here. In the archives we find it as Giadrescovo. There is evidence that even earlier, in Roman times or in the early Middle Ages, here existed a settlement, which between 13th and 16th century, was abandoned in the aftermath of war plunder, devastation, shortages and disease outbreak. A doctor,  Bernardo Schiavuzzi, recorded that this settlement was called  Lussàn or Lussanum whereas an Istrian historian  Camillo De Franceschi assumed that the settlement was not at the place of today's settlement Jadreški but in its close vicinity and that it should be searched in the ruins of the Marlera settlements, which was somewhat southwards of the mentioned settlement. Its inhabitants depended on agriculture, wine growing and cattle farming. At the beginning of the 20th century, ( according to the population census from 31 December 1910)  there were 323 people living in 53 family houses. Based on the language of communication they were all Croats. With the outbreak of World War I, at the time when the Kingdom of Italy was about to declare war on the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, after the announcment of 6 August 1914, at the command  of the fortification Commissioner of the Marine Fortress Pula, from 17 May 1915 the  inhabitants were forced to leave their homes and flee the country. After they had handed in their cattle, upon showing their documents to a military commissioner, they were gathered in Škatari, from where they were taken to Pula by the military forces. From Pula train station, in freight cars, ( like other war fugitives -Kriegsflühtlinger from the south of Istria) they were transported passing through Divača- Ljubljana - Ptuj - Maribor to the refugees camp (Barackenlager Wagna) near to Leibnitz. From Leibnitz people were first transported to the teritory of south Hungary and in mid-August 1915 were moved to a camp Gmünd and Steinklamm ( today Federal state of Lower Austria). In the exile 55 inhabitants of the village Jadreški died, of which 45 children. Small groups of people returned to their homes during February, March and April in 1918. During World War I,  there were only nine families left ( two families Jadreško, two families Peršić, one Božić, Ujčić, Čalić, Damjanić and Vitasović.) in Jadreški. These were the ones who could provide food and firewood for the next 90 days and were able to make their own provisions. In World War II after the capitulation of the Kingdom of Italy, 8 September 1943, in the vicinity of the village, in the forest of Magran, the first rebels' base was founded to which military equipment, weapons and ammunition were delivered from the fortresses Turtijan and Kaštijun enabling the constitutuion of Partisan military forces. During a violent scouting by the German military forces on 17 September 1943, after a tip-off, they established an armed contact with the rebels, suffered larger human losses while the rebels withdrew towards Kuići and Pavičini. Others, a smaller part of the German military, set seven houses on fire and more farm buildings, whose owners were National Liberation Movement (NOP) activists. In the front yard of the family Jadreško, brothers Miho and Blaž and their worker Anton Komparić were shot dead. During World War II 29 people from the village Jadreški lost their lives."
111,Ližnjan Tourist Board,Valtura,"Valtura ( Italian Altura), a settlement situated on a flat area from which steep slopes descend into the Budava Cove, 886 inhabitants (2011). The traditional industry is based on farming and cattle farming, wheras recently the majority of the population has turned to rural tourism.Thanks to its vicinity of Pula, part of the population commutes  for work to the biggest Istrian town every day . The quality stone from the quarry Valtura I and II is exported daily all over the world. Although Valtura was built on the foundations of an antique settlement, it is overshadowed by the near Nezakcij, a significant hillforth built by prehistoric Histri. The area is rich in archeological findings ( ruins of Roman architecture and findings, in 1899 a  pre-Romanesque pluteus was found) which indicates the existence of a Roman and early medieval settlement.In the wider area there is a great number of ancient and medieval archaeological sites: Kostanjica, the ruins of a Roman country villa and cremation graves near Ušićevi Dvori, the remains of ancient architecture in the forest of Magran ( Macrianum ) and in the surroundings of Strmotić. The today's village was founded in the 17th century by immigrants from Dalmatia, who were assigned the land of the Venetian Barbarigo family by the Captain of Rašpor in 1647. The nucleus of the village of Valtura was built around the ruins of the Church of St. Martin, at the site where a new church of St. John the Evangelist was built. In the centre of the place is a single-nave parish church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St. John in the neo-Gothic style with an octagonal belfry above the facade built in 1899. The church  contains valuable carved choir stalls wheras the bell tower of the church has the bell cast by master Gregory Zambelli in 1698. Muntić Muntić ( Italian Monticchio ) a settlement between Valtura and Loborika on the hill which dominates the southern part of the Pula area, 406 inhabitants (2011.). The population is mosty employed in the nearby Pula. The hillforth in the surrounding area indicates that the area has been inhabited since the prehistoric times, wheras Roman country villas in Radeki, at Stancija Wasserman prove its existence in ancient times. The historical sources indicate that the settlement was called Rumianum in the Middle Ages, while in the tenth century it was a feudal estate that belonged to the Bishop of Pula, to be later ceded to the Patriarch of Aquileia. Due to the plague and wars,  most of the surrounding villages in the southern Pula area as well as this area, Rumian, were deserted in the 16th century . The place was owned by Girolamo Barbarigo in the 16th century, but Venetian rulers inhabited  the settlement with refugees from Dalmatia in several waves (1530, 1579, 1583, 1588). The new settlement received the name Muntić, while in historical sources even in 1702 it was called Rumiani sive Montecchi. The single-nave parish church of St. Jerome  has an elegant bell-cot on the facade, while the sacred building was mentioned in the late 16th century although it may be even older.  The bell dates back to 1396. Inside the church there is a Gothic vaulted ceiling, a valuable statue of the Madonna and the painting of A. Samassa of the Madonna with Saints  (1827). Ušići dvori Ušićevi Dvori, Ušića Dvori, Ušićovi Dvori, Ušići (Italian Casoni, Stanzia Ušić), a small settlement with a few houses along the road between Šišan and Valtura. It is situated on a fertile area and is surrounded by forests, westwards Magran, eastwards Cuf. In the immediate vicinity of the settlement there are two pools, one of which still contains water.  The church of the Holy Family was built in 1905."

111,Ližnjan Tourist Board,Windsufring and kitesurfing,"The area of Ližnjan is widely known for its bora wind, a northeast wind that attracts many windsurfers and kiters throughout the year. Strong wind and big waves are the main reasons why many kiters and windsurfers from Croatia and abroad flock to the bay of Kuje. Its closed shape and deep sandy bottom provide safety during falls and extreme jumps. As waves become bigger and winds stronger, the adrenaline of kiters and windsurfers grows, their spectacular stunts leaving many spectators breathless. These sports do not require strength, but an understanding of the principles of controlling the kite or the sail attached to the surfer's waist by a harness. Failure to understand the principles of kite and wind operation can be very dangerous and lead to injury. It is important to point out that it is by no means recommended to practice kitesurfing and windsurfing without prior training and a good instructor. Locations suitable for kite and windsurfing: Kuje Bay and Marlera Location suitable for surfing (surfing on the waves without the use of wind): Marlera"

Summer vacation is the perfect occasion to try scuba diving and make the introductory dive, i.e. to discover the beauty of the underwater sea life in safe company of a certified diving instructor. For experienced and certified divers, there is opportunity to go to attractive natural diving sites nearby. Lopar is indeed Sandy Paradise! Lopar is indeed a SAND PARADISE! Miles of golden sand has been the trademark of Lopar and island of Rab for years since no other place in the Adriatic Sea is so well endowed with beautiful sandy beaches. Their number and diversity will meet different and the most demanding expectations. A chain of 22 sand beaches and many more small, picturesque bays and coves, usually with the sandy seabed, surround the Lopar peninsula and the nearby islands. Some of the beaches can be reached by car. Others you will have to discover on foot or by a boat. Chose your destination for the day and get a taxi boat at port Lučica or rent-a-boat. Beaches of Lopar welcome first swimmers already in May. The sea gets warm quickly in the spring sun, thanks to the shallow sandy seabed, so the swimming season opens early in May and lasts until late October, much longer than in other Adriatic destinations. Shallow waters have another advantage - the safety, especially safety for non-swimmers and kids, which can enjoy a carefree play in the sand and warm shallow sea. The biggest and the most famous beach of island Rab is definitely the Paradise Beach (known as ""Rajska plaža""). A bit less known, but equally popular among our guests are beaches Livačina, Stolac, Sahara, Mel and many others. You can chose between large beaches with full touristic infrastructure (bars and restaurants, deck-chairs and parasols, water sports and other entertainment) and other, smaller and more intimate beaches, sand or pebbles, with less or no touristic infrastructure at all, where you can fully immerse in the nature and merge with the environment. The Island of Rab has been the pioneer of naturism in the Mediterranean, with English royal family enjoying skinny-dipping in the early 20th century. Lopar has been on board with that trend ever since so nudists have always been welcome here and for their privacy and pleasure there are 3 FKK beaches: Ciganka and Sahara are nudism friendly (FKK allowed) and beach Stolac is nudist exclusive (FKK only). For physically challenged and for disabled, there are several ramps along the Paradise Beach, for their easier access into the sea. One thing we are sure of is that here you will find a beach to fall in love with and the swimming in our beautiful clear sea will become a treasured experience in your memories. Make sure you don't stop at the first beach but explore more of them. Start with the Paradise Beach and take the tour to Livačina, Stolac, Sahara, Podšilo, Dubac, Sturič, Ciganka, Sić, Crikvena, Dražica, Mel etc. What to visit in Lopar? In addition to the beautiful landscape of the peninsula of Lopar, which represents a protected geological heritage made up from Eocene marls and sandstones, and Lopar golden sand beaches, don''t miss out on the islets surrounding Lopar. Go for a day trip to the islets of Goli otok and Sveti Grgur or swim to the islets of Lukovac and Školjić located not far from Rajska beach. In the past, the islet of Lukovac served as a fort for thwarting attacks on the island and today we can find here the remains of an early Christian church. The islet of Školjić has become a favourite for visitors thanks to its extraordinary rock formations and, if you let your imagination run wild, you can find many different shapes in the rocks. Both of the islets are worth the visit as they are the perfect location for taking great photos and creating new memories in Lopar, the sandy paradise. Goli otok, once the largest penitentiary on the territory of former Yugoslavia, is a must-visit. It is precisely the notorious past of the island that draws numerous visitors today. The island known as ""the Croatian Alcatraz"" among tourists was opened after the World War Two in 1948 and closed in 1988. Although during the World War One the Russian POWs were briefly detained here, the sordid tale of the island was written during the Informbiro period between 1949 and 1958 when political dissidents, the opponents of Tito's Communist regime, were detained and tortured. Numerous collapsed buildings, penitentiaries and workshops are a testament to the cruel destiny of the prisoners on this barren island. The islet of Sveti Grgur, located between Lopar, Krk, Prvić and Goli otok, is the second greenest island on the Adriatic. Its beautiful beaches, bays, forests and the feeling of pristine nature are what attracts most yachtsmen and excursionists. Walks around the island are an ideal opportunity to meet friendly bucks and does roaming around freely. In addition to its lush vegetation, the islet boasts a rich history as it is home to the remains of the women's penitentiary and some 50 bunkers embedded in the rocky landscape. If you are into exceptional natural beauty and rich historical and cultural heritage, then the islets surrounding the peninsula of Lopar are the perfect place to visit. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and a good camera."
113,Lovran,Hiking trail Poklon - Vojak,"It takes approximately one and a half hours to climb from the Poklon pass (922 m) to the Vojak summit (1,396 m). The panoramic view spot, a stone tower, offers a fantastic view of Istria and Kvarner. There are a small hotel, a mountain lodge and an Učka Nature Park visitor centre on the Poklon pass. The Poklon pass can be reached by car from Ičići (12 km)."
113,Lovran,Hiking trail Medveja - Lovranska Draga - Vojak,"From the place of Medveja on the main road from Rijeka to Pula, 100 m before the entrance to the camp, marked forest road leads to the right alongside the camp. After travelling 400 meters to the west, the trail turns left to a stream, follows the stream and then starts uphill to meadows and vineyards below Lovranska Draga. Beyond this village, the path climbs steeply uphill to the marked route leading from Laz to Mala Učka. The path turns to the left, gently climbing to the south-southwest through a forest to Babin grob. From Babin grob it continues through meadows and karst terrain, crossing a stream and fir forest, leading to an unpaved road for the village Mala Učka. In the middle of the village is a marked path leading to the right and sharply uphill to the crest below the pass, following the crest to the saddle and from the marker leading sharply uphill to the peak of Vojak."
113,Lovran,Lovran,"The mediaeval town developed around the fortified mandrać, a harbour that connected Lovran with destinations near and far. The harbour, inevitably, also attracted adventurers, who spread the word about the beautiful and important town situated where the slopes of Učka plunge into the Adriatic Sea. In the 12th century, the renowned Arab cartographer al-Idrisi spoke highly of Lovran's shipbuilders and sailors. Five hundred years later, the famous travel writer Johann Valvasor praised the local produce: apart from the laurel after which the town was named, he was impressed by the large and sweet chestnuts and juicy Lovran cherries. These two fruits, whose taste cannot be matched anywhere in the world, are still the basis of local gastronomy. What has attracted travellers from all parts of Europe for centuries still captivates visitors to Lovran today: the fortified harbour in the heart of the town, the tower that stands guard over it and the historic centre full of stories and legends; the great culinary offer based on local ingredients; the unique climate that combines fresh mountain air and sea spray; and the beautiful nature that conquers at first sight..."
113,Lovran,Local attractions in a classy arrangement,"Before the new era, over two thousand years ago, Lovran caught the eye of the wealthy ‘rulers of Europe' - the Romans. Patrician families chose this coast for their summer residences. History repeated itself at the beginning of a new era of tourism. The local natural and cultural heritage, beneficial climate and historical sights made Lovran one of the key Adriatic destinations in the second half of the 19th century. The town expanded beyond its mediaeval walls and along the coast. According to the designs of Europe's leading architects, beautiful Secession-style villas were built, surrounded by lush parks with fantastic views."
113,Lovran,Franz Joseph I Coastal Promenade,"The beautiful promenade by the sea is one of the main attractions of Lovran and the entire Opatija Riviera. Officially named after Emperor Franz Joseph I, but popularly called Lungomare, it is a favourite promenade of the inhabitants of Lovran and their guests, the subject of countless photographs and paintings, and a key element of the view of Lovran from the sea. A walk between the lush parks and beautiful villas on one hand and sea waves on the other will reveal to you the rich architectural heritage of the aristocratic, merchant and artistic elite, but also a view of the sea and typical Mediterranean coastal scenery."
113,Lovran,Medveja,"The Greeks left these coasts where they once grew vines a long time ago and Medea remains only in literature and myth, but the beautiful beach and the place that was named after her - Medveja - today still capture the imagination of everyone who takes a swim in its crystal-clear sea. Medveja, a picturesque coastal fishing village located two kilometres from Lovran, is now a much sought-after tourist destination that offers relaxation in nature, away from crowds and stress. The connection between Medveja and the sea remains unbreakable. MTB trail Tuliševica (Marović) - Učka The bike trail begins in the Marović area above the village of Tuliševica. It is a forest road that first runs in the northern direction, then leads towards the Učka Tunnel, west towards the Grnjac summit (850 m), and further towards the village of Mala Učka. From the village of Mala Učka the trail goes through a plateau and a pine forest to the village of Vela Učka, and further along an asphalted road to the Poklon pass (922 m). The trail is 27 km long and the difference in height is approximately 450 meters. Nature park Učka"
113,Lovran,A wealth of life and nature - with a magnificent view,"The development of Mount Učka has been determined by the area's specific climatic characteristics. The mountain, whose slopes are ‘immersed' in the sea, is home to many endemic plant and animal species. This biodiversity, as well as the uniqueness of the mountain relief, is one of the reasons why most of the area today is protected as a nature park. In addition to Učka, the largest Istrian and Kvarner mountain, the Učka Nature Park also includes a part of the Ćićarija massif and covers a total area of 160 square kilometres. Each part of Mount Učka has its own story to tell: about people, deities, fairies and elves, as well as amazing natural, plant and animal beauties. In addition, the Učka Nature Park offers lots of excitement for adventurous guests. Thanks to a specially designed offer and sports and recreational facilities, in this area you can enjoy hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, free climbing, caving, adventure racing, paragliding, or simply walking along various educational trails with a total length of several dozen kilometres."
113,Lovran,The Old Town,"During the Middle Ages, cities were mostly built on hills, due to their strategic and defensive advantages. But the people of Lovran had a different strategy, taking advantage of the sea. Above the harbour, a town was built surrounded by solid walls and tall towers. To this day, Lovran's Old Town has retained its mediaeval Mediterranean atmosphere, which is best felt in the narrow streets and passages among its houses and squares, which in the past were the centres of social life. A walk under its densely-packed rooftops past the cortiles - small walled courtyards where the facades of the houses have colourful wooden windows and shutters, and tiny staircases are often ‘decorated' with vines - seems like a journey through time. It is easy to imagine the people passing by here several centuries ago: merchants carrying goods for exchange on the market, water carriers in search of customers, or locals on their way to the harbour, or square with the Church of St George (Sv. Juraj) and the seat of the town magistrate. The imposing town tower, which still stands guard over the entrance to Lovran's Old Town, reminds us of that time, when only massive walls guaranteed security to the town's inhabitants. The most important part of the mediaeval fortification system was the well-preserved eastern town gate called Stubica, which led to the heart of the town's economic activity: its harbour, or mandrać, as it is locally called. The turbulent history of the town, as well as later construction work, have not allowed the fortification system created during the late Middle Ages to remain fully preserved, but what remains still provides enough inspiration to imagine Lovran as the centre of trade and maritime affairs it was in the Middle Ages."
114,Center of the world,Center of the world,"Ludbreg is a town located in north-western Croatia, in upper Podravina region, in the eastern part of the Varaždin County, right where the picturesque slopes od the Kalnik become the tame Podravina plain. Ludbreg enjoys the good geographic position and the tame nature surrounding it, providing the visitors an honest and authentic experience, be it pilgrims, business people, outdoor lovers or travelers passing through."
115,Lumbarda,Lumbarda,"Korčula is a genuine treasure trove, and one of its most famous jewels is Lumbarda, a true symbol for the most delicious food, the most intoxicating wines and the most beautiful beaches. The famous aroma of the Grk wine and the unique gastronomy, the interplay of the sea and sand, all come together to provide you with an unforgettable experience in the hometown of the ancient Lumbarda Psephisma historical stone tablet."
115,Lumbarda,Lumbarda Walking trails,"Ražnjić (Prvi Žal - Cape Ražnjić) The trail starts from the center and leads 300 meters ahead to the Tatinja sandy beach located on the northern side of Lumbarda. There begins a beautiful promenade along the sea overlooking the Korčula islands, Pelječac Peninsula and the town of Orebić. The trail leads further to the Church of the Holy Cross built on a stone rock in the middle of a sandy field on the foundations of older buildings that are visible on the northeastern facade. The church was restored in 1774, which is evidenced by an inscription above the entrance. Liturgy is performed in the Church several times a year, and an especially ceremonial atmosphere can be felt on the feast of the Palm Sunday during the blessing of olive and palm branches. In the summer, the Church serves as an exhibition space where many, both academically educated and self-taught, artists from Lumbarda and the surrounding towns exhibit their work. The trail continues on a road through pine trees to Ražnjić, the easternmost cape on the island of Korčula, where there is a lighthouse and a small mooring. The cape and the peninsula were the first sight of the ancient Greek colonists when arriving to this forested island in the 6th century BC, so they called it Korkyra Melaina (black). From here, you can see the southern slopes of Pelješac, the island of Mljet, the lighthouse Glavat and the island of Lastovo."
115,Lumbarda,The wine route,"Nowhere in the world do vineyards in the sand, surrounded by the sea, bathe in the sun as they do in Lumbarda. This God's gift of Lumbarda hands is transmitted to the Grk wine. The Lumbarda Grk wine is of a lighter yellow color with a greenish reflection. During two years of maturation and aging, it changes in color from light yellow to golden yellow. Winemakers of Lumbarda are slowly but skillfully opening the doors of their wineries and tasting areas to wine lovers from all over the world, who visit the wine groves on the island of Korčula. They carry with them the memory of these magnificent flavors of the Croatian Mediterranean and a bottle for their respectable wine shops and restaurants. The trail leads to Lumbarda and offers beautiful views of the location and a walking route to the southern coast of the island. After leaving the vineyard fields, we slowly climb through the olive groves to a lookout point that provides an undisturbed view of the blue open sea. Salty fish seasoned with olive oil along with a glass of good wine in one of the local wineries will spice up the walk. St. Anthony (Prvi Žal - Račišće Bay - beach - St. Anthony's Church - Donje Blato - Prvi Žal) The trail leads along the sea, on rough rocks, next to houses with stone facades, and continues along the road next to the edge of the Račišće Bay. It approaches the place where the island of Vrnik is closest to Korčula. Stone has been the basic building material throughout the history of Dalmatia, and the same goes for the island of Korčula. However, good stone, and stone sculptors, could not be easily found. The development of stone quarrying and processing in Lumbarda lasted for centuries - there is evidence of the existence of quarries in ancient times - and the tradition is still alive, with Lumbarda stone sculptors that are widely known for their skills. Out of different sorts of stone quarried near Lumbarda and the surrounding islands, the most famous one is the stone from Vrnica sculpted by local artisans and used as a building material in many luxurious structures around the world - from Korčula, Dubrovnik, Istanbul and Venice to Vienna. The trail further offers an unusual walk to the St. Anthony's Church, along the seacoast and Solin, to a lookout point on the Pelješac Channel and the favorite tourist destination - an archipelago of 22 small islands, the most interesting of which are Vrnik, with a town carrying the same name, and Badija with a Franciscan monastery from the 14th century. The trail leads next to a small church dedicated to St. Liberan and along the sanctuary of St. Anthony situated on the hillside, which can be reached by climbing a picturesque high stone staircase with 102 steps surrounded by centuries-old cypresses. The church dates back to the 14th century and was restored at the end of the 17th century. The Pelješac Channel was an important historical maritime trade route, which means that the city of Korčula had a prominent strategic role. Many battles over this route have been fought throughout history, and the most famous one in 1298 between the Venetian and Genoese fleets, when the Genoese captured Marko Polo from Korčula, who fought on the Venetian side. The old route to Žrnovo (Javić - Gornje Blato - viewpoint - Žrnovo) The trail connects Lumbarda with Žrnovo, a village above the town of Korčula. Fishermen's wives from Lumbarda used this route in the past for selling fish after a good catch. Along with the fortified town of Korčula, Lumbarda is the oldest island village situated by the sea. Žrmovo, as well as other places on the island, is situated further away from the coast along fertile fields with its residents keeping boats and fishing tackles in nearby bays. Today, modest fishing houses have turned into holiday homes, and bays became popular tourist destinations. The trail begins in the Javić hamlet and winds through the plateau of Gornje Blato, where most of Lumbarda olive groves are located. From these olive groves comes a premium olive oil rich in fruity aromas thanks to a combination of traditional growing methods and contemporary fruit processing technologies. Leaving the olive groves, the trail leads uphill through the bushes to a lookout with a beautiful view and ends in Žrnovo, from where you can return to Lumbarda by bus, taxi or on foot the same way."
115,Lumbarda,Lumbarda cycling trails,"Cape Ražnjić Lumbarda - Cape Ražnjić - Church of the Holy Cross - Pržina Bay - Kosovo - Gornje Blato - Javić - 10 km The trail leads around Lumbarda and offers beautiful views of the location and its surroundings from the northern side of the island. A few visible remains of this area''s rich past can be seen along the trail: a 17th century square tower built on the still visible foundations of a Roman ville rusticae from the 1st century BC, the remains of the 15th century bishops'' summer residence along the sea on the northern side, and the Church of the Holy Cross built on the foundations of older buildings on the only rock in the middle of the sand field, which was restored in the 18th century. After passing through the Pržina Bay, we ride uphill to the Lumbarda bypass road, where you can enjoy a beautiful view of the place, the Pelješac Channel and škoji, and beyond it St. Eliah, the highest peak of Pelješac (961 m). We continue riding through Gornje Blato around the olive groves west of Lumbarda. Gornje Blato is the area where most of the Lumbarda's olive groves are located. For centuries, people in this area have been removing rocks from the land and arranging them into meje, dry stone walls stretching for miles and spreading through the whole area. In these ‘fenced' spaces, olive trees are still grown in the traditional way, without irrigation, which, along with modern fruit processing technologies, delivers top-quality olive oil rich in fruity aromas."
115,Lumbarda,Gornje Blato,"Lumbarda - Pržina Bay - Baruža - Glogovac - viewpoint - Gornje Blato - Humac - Lumbarda - 12 km The trail leads around an olive grove west of Lumbarda. In its southern part, the path leads abruptly uphill to 102 m above sea level, but the view from that location onto the islands of Mljet, Glavat with its lighthouse, škoji and Lastovo is worth the effort. On the way down to the town, through Gornje Blato and Humac to the Korčula - Lumbarda main road, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Lumbarda, the Pelješac Channel and St. Eliah, the highest peak of Pelješac (961 m). The town of Korčula became the cultural and administrative center of the island mainly because of its strategic position in the Pelješac Channel, and Lumbarda has always been closely associated with it. In Lumbarda there are still several well-preserved kašteli, fortified summer villas from the 16th and 17th centuries, built by wealthy Korčula families. The fields of Lumbarda provided Korčula with fruits and the renowned Grk wine, and even today the local bus is filled with škver (shipyard) workers and pupils attending schools in Korčula. Žrnovo Javić - Kosovo - Gornje Blato - Žrnovo - Lokva - Donje Blato - Lumbarda - 15,5 km The trail begins on the western side of the place, at the foot of the hill on the Koludrt Peninsula, where the Psephism was found - a Greek inscription from the 3rd century BC that documents the founding of an ancient Greek colony at the site of today's Lumbarda. The trail goes further, where there are no houses and where the empire of olives and wines begins. We come to a lookout point with a view over the Glavat lighthouse, Mljet and the islands of Lastovo. On poste around the small island of Glavat, seen in the distance and recognized by its lighthouse, the residents fished mostly sardines. People would spend several days fishing and the caught fish would be immediately salted. It is said that the truth can be found in wine. For residents of this place this is true in every respect. They fully live both with the Grk wine and from it. Below us, on the lunar landscape, hundreds of rows of grapevines are planted on wire fences and dug in under the white gravel cover. We stand between the sky and the stone in endless silence. The southern side of the island, the Defora Bay, is uninhabited because of the winter orchestral jugo that often foams the sea and the waves that rise up to makija, the bushes on the unprotected coast. the Lumbardian Psephisma"
115,Lumbarda,The Lumbardian Psephisma,"The Lumbardian Psephisma is the most famous Ancient Greek inscription in Croatia, but its meaning by far surpasses local and regional frameworks. Even in the corpus of global archaeological findings, it belongs in the top-class. We could ask ourselves: why does it deserve such fame?"
115,Lumbarda,The first-class historical testimony,"As the first-class historical testimony, the Psephisma has documented the foundation of the Greek colony on the soil of today's Lumbarda. In Hellenistic era, when the world was, much like today, caught up in the globalisation process, Ancient Greeks were trading their goods all over the Mediterranean, founding colonies, where they brought in not only their trade goods, but also their habits and culture. One of those colonies was in Lumbarda, as well. What separates it from many others is the Psephisma - its birth certificate! It is extremely rare, in global terms, that the testimony on the founding process has been preserved: from ecclesia's decision and agreements with local inhabitants to detailed rules of land distribution among the settlers, as well as sanctions awaiting the violators of those rules, ending with the list of all the settlers' names! From the moment it was found at the end of the 19th century, the Lumbardian Psephisma has been changing the history. Before its finding no one even knew that there was once an Ancient Greek city in Lumbarda. But since only the fragments were preserved, with the main part of the text missing, it posed a great challenge to the researchers that have been trying to interpret its content during the whole 20th century."
115,Lumbarda,The Lumbardian Psephisma - content,"According to modern interpretations, the text goes somewhat like this: May luck be with us. During the time of Hieromnemon Praxidamos, in the month of Machanemus, the contract about the founding of the settlement was drawn up between the people of Issa and Pyllos and his son Dazos. This is what the founders of the settlement agreed upon and what the people decided: that those who took the land first and walled the city would get special sites to build their houses inside the fortified city, that of the land outside the city, they would get separately the first lot of arable land of three plethrons, and that they would get parts of the remaining land; that it is to be written down what lot and what part did each of them get; that in theirs and their descendants' permanent possession is to remain one plethron and a half to each; that later settlers should be given four plethrons and a half from the undistributed land in the field; that the authorities should swear never again to divide the city or the land; that if any ruler ever suggests anything of the sort or if somebody agrees against this psephisma, they should fall under atimia, and their property should become the peoples' possession; whoever kills them should remain unpunished... These are the peoples that were given the land that who walled the city: Dymanes, Hylleis and Pamphyloi."
115,Lumbarda,Interpretations,"It has been concluded that the founders of the settlement have come from the Isle of Issa, today's Vis. As Dorians, they were divided into three phylai (tribes): Dymanes, Hylleis and Pamphyloi; that is why the founders' names were signed in three columns, according to affiliation. The representatives of each phyle formed the ecclesia, under whose authority were internal and external affairs of the polis. Ecclesia probably elected the Hieromnemon - the highest-ranking official whose range of duties encompassed both secular and religious aspects of the city's life. Since his mandate was annual, the people of Issa used it to count the years. That is why the Psephisma was dated by Hieromnemon Praxidamos' reign. Pyllos and his son Dazos could have been the representatives of the local Illyrian government, i.e. the original owners of the land. Psephisma shows that the settlement was founded upon agreement of the two sides, therefore, peacefully - which was not always the case."
115,Lumbarda,Gastro,"Lumbarda offers a large choice of restaurants, bars and taverns with traditional cuisine. Most of them serve vegetarian and children's menus à la carte. The rich veriety of meat and seafood specialties is matched by wine from the Lumbarda wine cellars. You should try famous white wine Grk indigenous to Lumbarda, and Plavac, Dalmatian favourite red wine."
115,Lumbarda,Beaches in Lumbarda,"Pržina beach What does that name mean? Pržina is local word for sand. Enough said... The beach is protected from the northern winds. Przina beach is very popular and well visited beach during the summer months, so it is sometimes overcrowded and it is difficult to find a place on the beach. It is favorite beach for tourists and for the local people, who come here to have fun and hang out. There is a bar on the beach in which are offered many refreshing drinks and fast food, and you can also rent parasols and deck chairs. Sandy Przina beach is not only visited by Lumbarda tourists, tourists from whole island Korcula are visiting this beach. Przina used to be nudist beach, but today nudists are on rocky parts of the Przina bay. Nudists enjoy privacy and crystal clear sea with view to sandy beach full of people. So close to everything but in the same time so far away. On rocky parts of the bay you can even find some shade from the pine trees above, and sunsets from that part of the bay is great. There is big parking place next to the beach so it is easy to get to Przina sandy beach by car. Bilin žal beach Another sandy beach in Lumbarda, Bilin zal. It is on opposite side of Przina beach. Bilin zal overlooking to the North-East, to Pelješac peninsula and islands of Korcula archipelago. Next to the beach is ancient building with nice restaurant inside. Along beach Bilin zal there is few meters high stone wall so there is shade on the beach in the afternoon. You can also rent parasols and sunbeds. You can try some water sports starting from pier close to beach. Big parking place is next to the Bilin zal beach, so beach is easy to reach. When you walk over rocks to the East you can find small pebble beaches, and nice flat stone areas. This part is called Lenga and it is paradise for nudists."
115,Lumbarda,Tatinja beach,"Only few minutes from Lumbarda center you will get to Tatinja beach. It is sandy beach, with view to the North, to island Vrnik, and Gubavac, and behind them mountain of Sveti Ilija with Orebić. Next to beach there is stone pier called Parapet, you can jump off it, or just watch local boys doing crazy jumps."
115,Lumbarda,Beach in Marina Lumbarda,"In the center of Lumbarda, on the north side of Marina there is a pebble beach looking to Lumbarda islands and Pelješac peninsula. On the beach there is nice cocktail bar. People can rent boats, jet skies, kayaks and go to windsurf school."

115,Lumbarda,Sacred heritage,"It is located on Vela glavica and dates back to 1680. It was dedicated in 1774 and expanded in 1886. Saint Rocco is the patron saint of Lumbarda and on his feast day (August 16) the procession goes through the field. The church is 9.5 m wide and 22.65 m long. The bell tower was newly built in 1996. Saint Roko is the patron saint of plague sufferers (XIV century). In the Renaissance art of St. Roko is regularly depicted in pilgrim's garb with a jagged shell (Jacob's cap), a bag, a staff and a gourd. He is usually seen in the company of his faithful dog. Church of St. Ivan It is a cemetery church. It is found in documents from 1388 in a ruined state. It was renovated several times, until 1893, when a new church was built on its foundations. It was demolished and a new one was built in 1893. Church of St. Barbara Located in the area of Žabnjak. It was first mentioned at the end of the 13th century. it was renovated: for the first time in 1728, and again at the end of the 19th century, when it got its present form.

115,Lumbarda,Church of Our Lady - Our Lady,"It originates from the 16th century. It is located above the sea on the western side of Mala Glavica. Church of St. of Spiridiu Located above Javić, it is a newer building. Chapel of St. Liberana Built as a votive after the earthquake in Dubrovnik in 1667."
115,Lumbarda,Cave of Our Lady of Lourdes,It was created after the apparition to Bernadette in Lourdes. Blessed in 1922.
115,Lumbarda,Grk,"Lumbarda is renowned for its Grk, made from the identically named indigenous type of grapes which grow well in the sandy vineyards of the village. It is not known whether Grk got its name from its refined bitter taste (grk means bitter in Croatian) or from the Greeks, who established a settlement in the area back in the 3rd century B.C. An archaeological monument from that period, the Psephism, records the foundation of Lumbarda and the early years of its wine-growing and wine-making already 2,300 years ago. The result of this rich wine-growing tradition combined with modern technology and oenology is a dry wine with exceptional characteristics: it is recognisable by its lightgreen-yellow colour with golden reflections, its emphatic cultivar aroma and its noble bouquet. It has a rich, harmonious and well-rounded taste with a slightly bitter finish. It contains 12-14% alcohol with relatively little acidity. Grk goes best with all sea-food as well as with white meat , but can also be served as an aperitif. It should be served cold at 12-13ºC."
115,Lumbarda,Plavac mali,"Besides Grk, Lumbarda also grows Plavac Mali - a variety of red grape chosen not only because it makes a good wine but also to help grow the Grk.

Plavac Mali is an indigenous sort belonging to southern Dalmatia and Croatia's most popular and best known wine abroad. Due to its high reputation for more than six centuries this wine used to obtain top prices among other Dalmatian wines.The best Plavac Mali comes from steep southern slopes - on the islands of Brač, Hvar, Korčula and Vis, and from those of the Pelješac peninsula. Lumbarda also produces a high quality. The dry wine from Plavac Mali grapes is dark red ,even garnet colour, with traces of purple, and has a rich bouquet embedded in a cultivar aroma and a warm, full and refined, well rounded, satisfying acerbic-to-soft taste. It contains 12-15% alcohol. Plavac Mali goes well with fine foods prepared with dark meats, especially wild game, and also with fish and strongly flavoured quality cheeses. It should be served at 18°C. Prošek Prošek is a sweet and sumptuously rich Dalmatian desert wine with high alcohol content. It is vinified from dried grapes, white or red, of diverse indigenous varieties, Grk and Plavac Mali being among the most appreciated. Few produce it and in very limited quantities. Prošek contains between 15 and 19 vol. alcohol and over 100g of unfermented sugar. It blends ideally with a range of cakes containing chocolate, walnuts, almonds and dried figs and also with mature cheeses."

The display covers three areas: the waterfront in front of the ship, the ship's main deck, and the steerage (former cargo hold). Multimedia display in steerage - presents life aboard a ship through five thematic units: crew, food, cargo, maritime routes, and construction and ship maintenance.

It presents the manual process of pressing olives in every detail, stacking them in baskets, and collecting the golden oil. The only remaining old olive mill was built around 1897 when there was a great need for olive processing, so at that time, two mills were still operating in Ćunski. The founders and builders of the mill formed the Armonia association, in which the owners shared profits proportionally to the number of shares. In addition to economic benefits, this association also cared for the advancement of the village and its residents.

With thick walls, small openings, and relatively low height, it resisted cannon fire from enemy ships for centuries and protected the population of Veli Lošinj from pirate raids. The crown of the tower has been renovated several times (1774, 1911) and has not reached us in its original form. Once a dominant building in the city harbor, in the early 19th century, it lost its military significance and gained symbolic meaning, appearing on the coat of arms of the newly established Veli Lošinj municipality.

119,Marčana,Bike and hiking trails,"341 FLANATICA TRAIL If you wish to discover the places emerged along the roman road which once was connecting Pula and Liburnia, choose the Flanatic track and depart from Marčana - a town of about 1.000 inhabitants, just 15 km distant from Pula. Formed on the fundaments of a prehistoric hill-fort and an antique village, during the middle age Marčana was heavily affected by several epidemics so, with the intention to repopulate it, in the 16th century the Venetians brought almost 200 Greek and afterward Dalmatian families. If you ride through it, you'll notice that the place is mostly weaved with rural architecture, with a line of family houses with cured gardens and fields with the only exception represented by the slightly protruded old school building with the clock and a cistern with two water wells in the sole town center. Bike path 342 - DIVŠIĆI We start from the crossroad in the center of Divšići in the direction of east towards Filipana. When leaving the village, we turn right, slightly downhill. We continue slightly downhill to the left. At the crossroad for Šarići drive right. At the Y intersection turn right onto the macadam. At the macadam road intersection drive straight west. We drive to the intersection with the main road Vodnjan - Barban and turn right on the asphalt up the hill. We drive along the main road slightly to the right up the hill. We enter the town of Divšići and turn right to our starting point. 343 PROŠTINA Bicycle path 343 Proština is 24 km long and connects to the Flanatica bicycle path in two parts. For the most part, it passes through unclassified roads and paths, and for a smaller part it passes or intersects with a local road. During the drive you can see untouched nature, cultural sights, small villages with a Mediterranean flair and a rich heritage. The eastern part of the path is only about a hundred meters from the sea, so there are paths that lead to nearby beaches for swimming. The course is of medium difficulty, with downhills, uphills and flats, as well as parts that require a lot of dexterity when going downhill for those who crave adrenaline. 344 MARČANA The trail starts below the village of Marčana, more precisely near the Kalić puddle, on the road to Duga Uvala in the direction of Mitrovi Dvori. The forest road leads to Muntić, where immediately at the junction with the asphalt surface, it turns left onto the white road and continues towards Nezakcij. After the archeological site of Nezakcij (Vizače), the trail passes along the road through the village of Valtura towards the local cemetery, where it diverges and enters the forest road. Through Radeki Polje, the trail continues on the paved road to Loborika and then to Radeki Glavica. Along the former horse center the path follows the white road and leads to Muntić. After a short drive through Muntić the path again switches to macadam. The ride along the Istrian olive groves ends in Marčana, where it started. The trail is easy, intended for leisurely riding, on a flat and not demanding surface, which can be performed by recreational cyclists and less physically fit cyclists, as well as families with children. PEDESTRIAN PATH 151 - Stjepan Hauser ""Under the village of Rakalj, the cold water is flowing..."" The Stjepan Hauser trail stretches between the village of Rakalj and the cold water, from the popular traditional song, that is from Kalavojna Bay through Luka Bay and all the way to the Saint Mikula Cape. The hiking trail is 3.3 km long in one direction and offers views of some of the most beautiful bays in Istria. Here you can also find some hidden beaches, just for yourself, and while walking enjoy the aromatic scents of spruce, sage and immortelle... And maybe, if you're lucky, you'll meet Stjepan Hauser!"

119,Marčana,Snorkeling,"Školjić Školjić beach is located 2.5 kilometers from Kavran, from where you take a local road with a wonderful view of Kvarner and the island of Cres. There are several macadam paths leading to Školjić beach, and you will recognize one wider branch by the asphalt on the initial part of the path (some 20 meters), which then continues as a white road to the beach itself. At its end there is a short concrete descent with rope handrails. Školjić is a small beach with tiny pebbles, while the rest of the bay is surrounded by beautiful rocky slabs with small recesses for those who want some privacy. Every corner of this beach has a view of the island of Cres. On the left side of the bay, looking towards the sea, you will notice a slope of rocks that sharply descend into the sea, but also providing some excellent places to rest on that side as well. There is a small canyon, a notch, with an imposing stone column behind which shyly peeks a small pebble beach with a wonderful golden and orange gorge. The bottom of the beach starts with small pebbles that gradually fall onto the stone plateau. On the southern side of the bay, at a depth of 5 to 6 meters, you can notice an interesting shape of rocks that from the surface resemble a sunken jetty. If you dive down, you can look underneath as this where groupers and cuttlefish as well as shoals of mullets live and hide. Following the coastline in the direction of the small canyon, in the shallowest part you will notice a lot of stone arms reaching a depth of 2 to 3 meters, looking as if they were carved. Between each arm there is a rounded notch, in places resembling a slide. They are very interesting to explore, especially if you go towards the land because almost every one of them takes you under the rocks with towels, hiding schools of small fish and crabs. If you swim towards the canyon, you will come across a slightly larger, round notch which bottom is strewn with small pebbles, but do not try to enter because it is too narrow. The view of the small canyon from the sea is truly unique. Exploring further along the coastline in a northerly direction you will notice a longer stone wall on land above the rocks. At the end of that wall, at a depth of 3 meters, lies a real surprise of this beach, namely two underwater arches that are easy to dive through. You will recognize them easily if you do a shallow dive because they have a longer roof in the shape of a blue shark head. The bottom under the arches is gravel. When you dive through the smaller arch and if you continue to swim towards the land, right under the stone wall on the rocks, you will notice another tiny ring-shaped passage less than a meter deep, overgrown with brown algae as a carpet. You can easily dive through, but do not go through the smaller passage as you can get stuck. You can continue to explore the coastline further, but the depth increases. Or you can swim back through the middle of the bay towards the pebble beach, because the bottom is on average 3 to 4 meters deep, and offers a wonderful view of large boulders. The conger eel hides here, as well as the moray eel, a rare inhabitant of the northern Adriatic. Both have a serpent-like appearance, but the conger eel is gray-black and likes to live in small holes and caves, while the moray eel is dark brown with yellowish spots and likes to hide in crevices and piles of stones. You can even watch them up close, but never tease them with your fingers because they both have a strong bite and poisonous blood, while the moray eel is also known for its poisonous mucus. Large shoals of deep-sea mullets and garfish swim through this bay, although the permanent in habitants include damselfish, mullets, the saddled seabream, the painted comber and the black scorpionfish. Krnički Porat Port of Krnica or Krnica harbour is a sea bay at the foot of Krnica, situated deep inland and well protected from the southern and northern winds. This was once a station of the Austro-Hungarian gendarmes, and later of the Italian finance, during the Kingdom of Italy, as the merchant ships from all over the northern Adriatic docked here in search of a safe haven exchanging goods and catches. Today, the Port of Krnica is home to fishermen and boats, while the beautiful beaches located on its northern coast, which can be reached by a short few minute walk along the white road, give it that little something extra. At the end of the road, there are several houses and a small pebble beach with benches and shade for those who arrive first. The Krnica harbour snorkeling location stretches from the small strand, across the first, to the second beach. The bottom in the shallows is covered with small pebbles, while in the deeper parts of the sea there are larger stones of various shapes that fall like a waterfall on the sandy bottom of the bay. In the shallow parts, especially near the small strand, you can see larger boulders, among which schools of small fish hide. You should be careful of urchins if you don't wear fins. While exploring the bottom in the shallows along the coastline, you will notice rocky furrows overgrown with brown algae resembling small groves with trees and branches swaying with the waves. They are a sign of a healthy and clean sea, and an excellent shelter for various types of combtooth blennies. If you look carefully at the rocks, you will notice small, regular holes. They were hollowed out by date shells, a strictly protected Adriatic bivalve. The low walls are decorated with various types of fescue and sponges, a snail gathering location.   Under each stone, you can find an interesting fauna of small crabs and brittle stars that rush around in search of a shelter because they are the favourite food of numerous fish. Where the rocks stop and the sandy bottom begins, you can find various live shells such as oysters, warty venus clams and scallops that can also swim, especially if you scare them. On such a mixed bottom, strewn with stones and overgrown with algae, you can find small soles and cuttlefish, because this type of bottom is ideal for them to hide, snails, various starfish, golden anemones and a hermit crab that lives in a symbiosis with the sea anemone it carries on its back. On the slope towards the bottom, the stones are dotted with yellow tube sponges, dark green sponges and small, white clumps of algae that are home to painted combers, combers and the peacock wrasse. Under the second beach, at a depth of 4 metres, there is a small but well-preserved colony of light brown, round and oval-shaped sod corals. As the seabed in this bay remembers some ancient times, you can also find an occasional scale weight that might have been used in the exchange of goods from merchant ships, even a bullet, but also a bottle (perhaps rum?) thrown from a pirate ship. There are old petrified ship ropes saved from oblivion, fragments of Roman amphorae and who knows what other treasures hide here to be discovered because throughout history this bay was the outlet of Krnica and the surrounding villages to the sea and their connection with the rest of the world."
119,Marčana,What to see in Marcana,"Kavran is located on a plateau 150 meters above sea level, above the bays of Budava and Vinjola. It was already inhabited in prehistoric times (Neolithic boulders on Vela Gromača), and the area was also attractive in ancient times due to its location and Kvarner view. In the Middle Ages, it belonged to the Mutvoran castle, that is, to the bishop of Pula, and it was almost abandoned after the plague and wars in the 16th century. The settlement was repopulated in the 17th and 18th centuries by refugees from Dalmatia and Boka Kotorska. In the village, the church of St. Jerome from the 18th century, a single-nave church with a side chapel and sacristy and 3 stone altars. There is a bell tower on the front of the church, and the church circle is entered through a stone archway. There is a well next to the church. Kavran offers a beautiful view of the sea and rocky beaches of dreams with a designated snorkeling location in Školjić cove for exploring marine biodiversity, a pet friendly beach at Punta Sika, swimming, walking and relaxing by the Kašalver pond and numerous forest paths woven with dry stone walls. On the road that leads from Marčana to Duga Uvala, it turns towards Mutvoran - a settlement with a small number of inhabitants, whose glorious past is reminded by the remains of prehistoric and medieval castle walls, such as the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene with extremely valuable artistic equipment (wedding wreath and altar) and a bestiary displayed in the lodge in front of the entrance to the village. Mutvoran was built on the site of a former Bronze Age and Iron Age castle settlement, from which two rows of concentric ramparts are visible today. Individual monuments indicate the life of the settlement from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Mutvoran is mentioned in many medieval debates about borders (1150. Castrum Monsmarianus, 1325. in the division of Istria when Motmorani et al.). Since 1331, it was under the administration of the Republic of Venice, whose construction activity is the most visible today. After the Uskok wars and the great plague in 1631, the settlement slowly lost its importance. Today, efforts are being made to preserve the cultural and historical value of Mutvoran with interpretive walks that pass on lines from the famous history to future generations. Marčana is located north of Pula, at the intersection of the Pula-Labin and Vodnjan-Krnica roads. It is the administrative seat of the Municipality of the same name and the office of the Tourist Board. The inhabitants are engaged in traditional agriculture and tourism, and some of them work in other service activities. Historical sources bear witness to the dense population of these areas in Antiquity and to the stormy past. Marčani is mentioned for the first time in written sources in 1243 in the act of Pula's oath of allegiance to the Venetians (Andreas de Marzana and Joanes de Marzana). Namely, at that time Marčana belonged to the Pula area, and then in 1331 it came under the rule of the Republic of Venice. Since during the 15th century plague epidemics raged through this area on several occasions, Marčana and its surroundings were almost left without inhabitants. During the 16th century, the Republic of Venice systematically settled the area with refugees fleeing from Greece and Dalmatia before the Ottomans. The town center is dominated by the three-nave parish church of St. Peter and Paul from the 15th century with a 25-meter bell tower from 1846. In Marčana there is also the medieval church of St. of Anton Padova, extended at the end of the 16th century and consecrated in 1709. Rakalj, located on the eastern coast of Istria, offers everything a tourist could wish for: peace, relaxation, a stunning natural coastline, Mediterranean fauna, and cultural-historical heritage. Therefore, it is an ideal place for an ""exploratory"" holiday. At the entrance to the village, there is a large local cistern, built through a joint effort by the people of Rakalj and put into ""operation"" in 1954. The main square is dominated by the Loredan Palace, constructed by the family of the same name, who ruled the area of Rakalj and nearby Barban from 1536 until the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797. Less than a hundred meters away, the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with its Baroque-period bell tower, stands out in the local cemetery. Nearby is a museum showcasing a memorial collection dedicated to economist and one of Istria's greatest writers, Mijo Mirković, also known as Mate Balota. This area has been known for its pottery since ancient times. Pottery can also be found in the museum, although traces of pottery-making are visible in the form of stone kilns scattered throughout the village, as well as the pot sculpture. Belavići is a small village above Raški Bay and the Blaz Cove, with about 30 inhabitants. It is particularly interesting because it is tied to an intriguing legend—the legend of King Tomislav's crown. The crown was allegedly hidden in the picturesque Blaz Cove, but to this day, no one knows where it is or whether it exists at all. According to the story, the crown and royal insignia were hidden in this cove following a conflict between two ships—one of which was transporting the royal insignia to Naples, where a coronation was to take place. The future king was supposed to be crowned with the Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen, as well as the Croatian Crown of King Tomislav. As battles raged between the candidates for the royal throne, the ship was intercepted by the vessel of an opposition candidate who was also vying for the crown. Thus, the ship carrying the scepter, crown, and sword ended up in Raški Bay, specifically in Blaz Cove. The valuable treasure was unloaded and hidden so skillfully that its exact location remains unknown to this day. Krnica has never been a typical small medieval town like many other smaller places in Istria. It has always remained open on all sides, with a central square featuring a row of restaurants, cafes, and shops. It's a place for gathering and socializing. This has been true not only today but since the town's founding in 1520, though it's believed that Krnica was inhabited even earlier, possibly in prehistoric and ancient times. When it comes to Krnica's cultural and architectural heritage, despite being a relatively young place in Istria, two small churches stand out. The single-nave parish church is dedicated to St. Roch, built in 1631 and expanded in 1774. It features a distinctive bell tower, which is separate from the church. The bell tower is an impressive 25 meters tall and was constructed only in 1882. Between Prodol and Divšići lies the small village of Filipana, a rural parish center built on the foundations of a prehistoric hillfort and a Roman settlement. In ancient times, this area was traversed by the well-known Roman road from Pula to Liburnia, and Filipana played a dual and significant role during that era. It served both as a military fortress and as an agricultural center used by military veterans. The deep history of this small village, with only about a hundred inhabitants, is evidenced by the fact that it was mentioned as Philippanum as early as 990 AD. Hreljići, a village with only 25 house numbers located between Krnica and Barban, got its name from the Hrelja family and is widely known for its magnificent church. The Church of Our Lady of Health is an established pilgrimage site, built in 1726. The story of why the church was constructed in this particular location is quite interesting. The villagers of Belavići, Bratulići, Kuići, Manjadvorci (formerly Prdajci), Hrelići, and Biletići had been attending mass at the Church of St. Dionysius, situated at the border of Barban, Mutvoran, and Rakalj, since the Middle Ages. However, this location was too far for many of them, so in 1724, the village officials from these settlements decided to petition the feudal lord Antonio Loredan to build a church in Hreljići. Loborika, the closest village to Pula, is one of the largest settlements in the municipality of Marčana, welcoming all visitors coming from the direction of Pula. Surrounded by rich oak forests, fields, olive groves, and vineyards, it has recently become known for cycling and renowned athletes who have brought fame to its name through this sport. The central part of the village is the main square, bordered by the local primary school and a small picturesque church dedicated to St. Florian, whose feast is celebrated at the end of October. This simple, single-nave church captures attention with a pre-Romanesque relief of an angel, symbolizing the evangelist Matthew. Together with John's eagle, embedded in a local family house, and Mark's lion, now part of the lapidarium at the Monastery of St. Francis in Pula, it once formed a complete set. The interior of the church features a wooden altar with a painting by A. Moreschi and a silver processional cross. The people of Orbanići proudly recall their tradition of donkey racing, which is organized every year on May 1st, the feast day of Saints Philip and James, coinciding with Labor Day. This race is unique not only because the locals compete on donkeys, but also because the tradition has been upheld for 50 years, making it one of the oldest such races in Istria. It is the highlight of the village festival, eagerly anticipated by everyone. In the past, almost every family in the village owned a donkey, so it made perfect sense to organize this type of competition for the entertainment of the villagers and their guests. Nowadays, donkeys are brought in from other places for the race, as there aren't enough in Orbanići. The donkey race starts in front of the community center, and all the competitors must complete a lap around the village as quickly as possible. The winner receives a special prize, followed by the traditional breaking of the ""pijadina"" bread. Pavićini - Šegotići - Peruški In the not-so-distant past, due to the karst landscape that did not offer ideal conditions for agricultural production, the residents of Pavićini were engaged in the traditional production of lime. Pavićini, along with Šegotići and Peruški, were well-known for their lime kilns, where quicklime was produced. This industry particularly flourished in the 1930s, when as many as 50 kilns would be fired in certain areas. The quicklime produced in this process was transported to nearby Krnički Porat, where it was loaded onto ships and sailboats, then shipped to towns on the western coast of Istria or to Italy. It was a highly sought-after building material due to its quality. At the same time Krnica was founded, the village of Divšići was also established, and today it has around 200 inhabitants. This occurred in the 16th century when a large number of people from Dalmatia settled in the area around Marčana, fleeing from the Ottomans. They sought refuge here and built new homes, engaging in viticulture, olive growing, farming, and livestock breeding. The village itself does not have a church, but in the 18th century, a small, simple church dedicated to Saints Vitus and Modest was built just south of the village, featuring a belfry and a porch.

Here is also the most famous sandy cove - the protected archaeological site Stari Trogir (""Old Trogir"")."
121,Marina Municipality,Marina,"The inhabitants of Marina settled around the church and Kaštila and protected their dwelling by a high stone wall, which resisted the enemies' attacks and preserved the life in Marina till today. Field crops, vine, figs, cereals, leguminous plants and olives fed generations in the region. Olive oil stemming from olive-groves around the town is superior in quality to other Dalmatian olive oils. Products such as honey, wool, sheep-milk cheese and others have always been of superb quality, and the blue cove of Marina was a real paradise for catching oily fish. Marina has around 1,000 inhabitants and is the municipal center of the region. People have engaged in tourism for about 50 years, with the capacity of 4,000 beds, mainly in private accommodation. Clear sea and neat beaches, together with cultural events, especially those taking place in Citadela fort in the old core of Marina during the summer, delight all guests.

121,Marina Municipality,Camino route,"Camino Šibenik is a beautiful coastal Camino route, that leads you through the Mediterranean landscapes with stunning views of Adriatic islands, olive groves, vineyards and beaches."
121,Marina Municipality,Rural tourism,"Rural tourism is thriving in several villages in the Marina hinterland. Rural areas and farms play an important role in the tourist offer of the Marina municipality: there is growing interest and demand for locally grown and processed foods. Thanks to its location and specific microclimatic benefits, the tradition of olive growing, viticulture, fruit growing, and even fishing in the Marina municipality dates back to ancient times. Agricultural crops from the sun-bathed terrains of Marina are grown, processed and enjoyed following recipes that were inherited and perfected for generations, so today's producers proudly point out the originality and authenticity of their agricultural products, and it is with good reason that the tourist community gladly includes them on their menu. The location of the rural estate, the traditional equipment and the way it is used, as well as all phases of growing and processing different cultures, have become sought-after tourist attractions in ecologically aware tourism. There are more and more visitors, especially from highly urbanized areas, who want to get acquainted with the authentic way of life of their hosts. Everything can draw attention and interest: from folk architecture to the finest ethnological details. Marina is said to be ""the most fruitful olive-growing municipality of Croatia"". Official data mention a million trees of, mostly, the indigenous Oblica variety, but also Italian variety Levantinka and others, but in reality, there are certainly way more than a million of them. Oil from olive groves of Marina is processed by local oil mills - oil mill Bilaja, oil mill PZ Marina, oil mill Smoljić and oil mill Mitlo, and the oil can be tasted in the tasting rooms of family farms: Oro Olive Oil and family farm OPG Šalov. Today, extra virgin olive oil is obtained through solely mechanical processes, by squeezing the olives under a cold press, immediately after harvest. This process ensures maximum preservation of the desirable biochemical components of the olive (carotene, lecithin, polyphenols, vitamins A, D, E and K) with a minimum content of fatty acids. Due to its exceptional nutritional and medicinal properties, quality olive oil is widely used in cooking, cosmetics and pharmacology. The olive is a long-lived tree; in Dalmatia, centuries-old olive groves are fairly common. Olive wood is specific - it is hard and brittle, and its unusual marbling in cross-section makes it suitable for making both decorative and everyday items. In addition to the production of olive oil, OPG Šalov also makes souvenirs from olive wood. The gastronomic offer of caterers and farms of Marina is based entirely on the Mediterranean roots and local culinary customs, locally known as ""užance"". Cheese and prosciutto from local family farms, salted sardines and anchovies, meat and fish dishes, cooked or grilled - or as the locals say prepared ""na gradele"", seafood dishes (shellfish, crabs, squid and octopus) and Dalmatian pašticada are gastronomic delights one should not miss. Those are served with a variety of side dishes: anything from vegetables grown in local vegetable gardens to wild plants, such as wild asparagus, which is harvested in late spring on dry rocky terrain and which is appreciated not only for its special taste, but also due to the quite demanding ways it is picked. The wines enjoyed here also come from local vineyards. The tradition of growing vines dates back thousands of years. In the Marina area, the black varieties Babić, Plavac and Ljubica, and the white varieties Mladinka, Kuč and Žutina thrive excellently. Even back in the old times, the farmers of the Marina area knew that wine is food - during their hard work in the fields, they would enjoy ""supa"", plain bread soaked in wine, as refreshment. Rural tourism is thriving in several villages in the Marina hinterland. These are Vinovac, Mitlo, Rastovac, Dograde, Gustirna, Najevi, Pozorac, Vrsine, Blizna Donja and Blizna Gornja. Ancient archaeological finds in the village of Blizna Gornja testify to the continuity of population in this area, the reason for which are the water sources and ponds that do not dry up, not even in summer, and which in the past played an important role in livestock farming and agriculture. Fragments of pottery from Roman times were found near Lokve by Blizna. Sediment from the bottom of these ponds, which collects during the lower, summer water levels, has long been used as fertilizer in horticulture and viticulture. There is a bicycle rest area on the site. A picnic area with picnic tables is located in the nearby the Bliznice ponds, near the village Gustirna. The beauty of Bliznice makes it worth to visit the area in any season, but especially in the spring, during the flowering of water lilies, whose floating blossoms add a ""mystical"" note to the beauty of this place."

It is significant as a kind of a first museum in the open, i.e. a collection of Roman stone monuments from Narona because numerous stone inscriptions, fragments of stone architecture and sculptures are built into its walls and thus remained preserved and visible. It is interesting that built into it are some transcripts of antique inscriptions that left Vid. After an exciting ride and walk through history, taste our specialties. All of our restaurants provide a wide choice of dishes, from tra¬ditional European cuisine to unusual specialities created by fusing the culinary tradi¬tions of both East and West. One of the best- known gastronomic specialties, famous all over Europe, is the local ""Neretva brujet"" in which the main ingredi¬ents are eel and frog. Sometimes, one finds flounder in this fa¬mous dish and it is known that it only inhabits the cleanest waters. The preparation of ""brujet"" is apparently simple but this is just an illusion because every Neretva kitchen, every restau¬rant and every house has its own method and secret of how its brodetto differs from others and it is quite difficult to say which is best. The eel can be baked on a stick and it is good to eat dry as well. Neretva cuisine also has dishes and specialties prepared from wading birds, especially coots. The proximity of the sea ensures that fresh marine fish are caught by local fishermen in the Neretva channel. Nere¬tva cuisine also comprises cas¬serole dishes (""sačura""). If you go on a photo safari by a traditional Neretva boat called ladja, the experience will be complete. In Neretva valley you can find other routes (not all of them are marked as bicycle routes), but you can enjoy and explore the area. Every year there are several cycling events: XCM Stipe Čamber race held in February, Primavera - a unique bike race for ladies in spring and XC Žabica, children`s race in autumn. Neretvanski đir is also driven in Metković. This two-day event consists of two cycling races: MTB race in the eliminator discipline XCE """"Metković"""" which is also the national championship of Croatia, and UCI class 2 international MTB race XCO """"Predolac"""" which is scored for the XCO Cup of Croatia."
125,Metković,A journey through the flavors of the Neretva valley,"While enjoying the land¬scape of the region, tourists can sample the delights of many specialities including fish and frogs, as well as the fruit and vegetables which grow here in abundance. Cruising in an an¬cient Neretva boat through the meandering rivulets and chan¬nels of the Neretva valley, one can enjoy the clear waters of the Norin, a tributary to the Neretva, and can pass by float¬ing islets with many fauna and flora. Stories will be told of sunk¬en towns, of ancient heroes and famous travellers who wrote down their fascination with the region, thereby recording their impressions of the Neretva val¬ley for eternity. These ancient towns and their walls which the water reveals from time to time are picked out in the remains of Roman villae rusticae scattered all along the way. They are also proof that the swamp was a fertile soil which nourished the ancient Narona and which exported its prod¬ucts to other regions of the Empire. The Neretva boat, a solid, large-ribbed vessel of sound proportions is the most beau¬tiful way of appreciating the many facets of the swamp and which can provide you with local refreshments, along with entertainment by the ""Neretva pirates"" armed with accordi¬ons, guitars and mandolins. The voyage can start from the pier at Vid, on the Norin, both upstream and downstream, but also from other places in the surroundings of Metkovic. Navigating the waters of the Kuti Lake in the south-western part of the valley is a special experience. For those who wish to taste local food in a calmer and more intimate ambience, a series of excellent restaurants is recommended: ""Đuđa i Mate"", at Vid, the restaurant ""Vrilo"" at Prud, res¬taurants ""Adria"" and ""Lanterna"" in Metkovic, ""Villa Neretva"" in Krvavac II. and many others. All of them provide a wide choice of dishes, from tra¬ditional European cuisine to unusual specialities created by fusing the culinary tradi¬tions of both East and West.

Birdwatching in and arround Metković The Neretva valley, together with its swamp-dwelling birds, (permanent and migratory), has been proclaimed A Swamp Area of International Value at the Ramsar Convention on the Protection of Swamp Areas. It has also been protected by the programme of the Important Bird Areas in Europe by Bird Life International. The variety of bird species in the Neretva valley attracted the attention of numerous visitors, travel writers and scien¬tists. Ornithologists have noted more than 310 species in the last hundred years and the va¬riety of bird-life is well rep¬resented in the Natural History Museum in Metković. Flocks of turtle-doves, goldfinches, cuckoos, etc. nest, feed, call and flutter in the bushes and groves of the nearby areas. On the highest and most inaccessible places, there live golden eagles, snake-catching eagles, falcons and windhovers; but also wood pigeon, white swifts ... There is not a single histori¬cal or noble coat of arms in the Neretva region without a falcon. Swallows, swifts and the ubiquitous sparrow build their nests and find their food near the settlements. They can be quite tame, en¬livening gardens, orchards and vineyards. 21 species nest in swamp habitats: grebes build floating nests in deeper waters; in the willow groves and reeds, there are colonies of cormo¬rants, herons and egrets feed¬ing on the amphibians, reptiles, small fish and mice. Three sorts of duck nest in dense swamp land: the wild duck, Garganey (Anas querquedula) and auk. The most popular bird in the Neretva for hunters and gourmets is the black coot (Fulica atra) due to its excel¬lent taste. The pebble banks of the Neretva offer a refuge to numerous smaller birds, as well as to those excellent div¬ers: the Kingfisher and Beeeater. Resident bird make up only a third of the species in the Neretva-the majority are migratory. When ice and the winter snows cover nourthern Europe, they come to the Neretva. The ornithologist Rucner says: ""The great migration of birds in the estuary is a precious and inde¬scribable experience which should not be missed by anyone who is involved in this science."" We would add that am¬ateurs would be no less amazed. The Neretva is almost a perfect winter area for birds. It is an ecologically interesting combination of con¬tinental and north sea condi¬tions set in the Mediterranean, where migrating birds find im¬portant biotopes and habitats identical to those in which they nest. They recognize an area abundant in food and climati¬cally ideal as the waters do not freeze up. When the sea recedes at low tide, a multitude of small worms, crabs, shells and small¬er fish remain on the sandy and silted banks, offering a feast for the flocks of terns, gulls and trill-sounding birds and other species belonging to the banks of northern seas, north¬ern tundra, and even some of them to the African belt. Due to its position on their migration to Africa, the Neretva has an exceptional frequen¬cy of birds. The large swamplands with¬in the valley, flooded wood¬lands and karst woods attract a variety of species. Flocks of snipes, coots, egrets and even seventeen spe¬cies of duck inhabit the area by the swamp region, next to the channels and reed-beds. There are also several species of geese here. Ornithological reserves Pod Gredom and Prud encompass the rest of the wetland of the Neretva delta of a surface of approximately 880 hectares and are one of the rare preserved Mediterranean reed beds. They have had the status of a Special Ornithological Reserve since 1965 and in 1993 they were included in the List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance and are a part of the European Natura 2000 protected areas network. Its main feature is the thick marshland vegetation comprised of reed beds and other wetland flora so that it is ideal for nesting and wintering of different bird species among which the most significant are the populations of the great bittern (Botaurus stellaris), common little bittern (Ixobrychus minutus), western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca). It is interesting that this is one of the Neretva nesting grounds that is the only coastal nesting of bearded reedling (Panurus biarmicus); it is also important for the populations of the water rail (Rallus aquaticus), spotted crake (Porzana sp.), warblers (Acrocephalus sp.) and other species. The river Neretva unites the region surrounding this fertile valley in which the riches of nature grow. The diversity of animal life here is preserved in ornithological reserves. The best example of a rich and diverse bird population of the Neretva delta can be observed in the Natural History Museum in Metković. Its ornithological collection was founded by famous Croatian ornithologist Dragutin Rucner. Unfortunately, the dalmatian pelican, griffon duck and marbled teal are gone, but even today we can see bitterns and ferruginous ducks nesting in the Neretva delta. The delta is an important resting place for millions of migratory birds but also a popular destination for many nature lovers. The Neretva boat, a solid, large-ribbed vessel of sound proportions is the most beau¬tiful way of appreciating the many facets of wetlands. Cruising in an an¬cient Neretva boat through the meandering rivulets and chan¬nels of the Neretva valley, one can enjoy the clear waters, and can pass by float¬ing islets with many fauna and flora. How to spend your weekend? Come to Metković!"
125,Metković,Archaeological museum Narona,"The remains of the ancient city of Narona, today''s Vid are 4 km southwest of Metković, where the Archaeological museum Narona is built, as the first """"in situ"""" museum in Croatia. Built on the locality of an antique temple dedicated to the 1st Roman emperor Augustus, it shows a unique collection of antique statues made sometime in the 1st century B.C. The Archaeological museum Narona is a unique and unavoidable destination for all lovers of culture, art, history and archaeology."
125,Metković,Narona,"The settlement at today's settlement of Vid is mentioned as early as the 4th century BC, and it reached its peak at the times of the Roman Empire as the important town of Narona, one of the most significant administrative and economic centres of the Roman province of Dalmatia. This is witnessed by the very well preserved remnants of the town walls which, descending from the top of the hills towards the valley, close the area in the form of a fan. They are comprised of the Northern and Western town walls adjoined to which are the square ground plan towers and the town gate on the Northern wall. They were built in several stages, from the Hellenistic times and the 4th or 3rd century BC, during the 2nd century BC until the last stage from the 2nd century and the times of the barbaric invasions on the territory of the Roman Empire. Thus, in the early stage, at the top of the hill, two towers of a round ground plan were built; in the later stages, they were turned into square towers and walls were built and renovated according to need. The defence wall is preserved in some places up to the height of several meters and as such, represents the most preserved antique town walls in Dalmatia. On the Western wall, beside one of the towers from the Roman period, Fr. Bariša Ereš, a local pastor, in the 19th century built a house known among the people as the Ereš Tower. It is significant as a kind of a first museum in the open, i.e. a collection of Roman stone monuments from Narona because numerous stone inscriptions, fragments of stone architecture and sculptures are built into its walls and thus remained preserved and visible. It is interesting that built into it are some transcripts of antique inscriptions that left Vid. parish church of Our Lady of Snow At the place of today's parish church of Our Lady of Snow in Vid, until the start of the 20th century, there was a small church dedicated to Virgin Mary, probably originating from the late Middle Ages. The construction of today's church started in 1935 according to the design of Eynar Dyggve, an eminent Danish architect and conservator. Until the 1960s, when the building was completed, the design was changed several times but the church kept most of its original appearance such as the expressed influence of the old Croatian pre-Romanesque sacral architecture, in particular the breakdown of external walls and the apse by buttresses and the breakdown of the interior into three naves, while the bell tower was built according to the drawing of Đena Hamzić. At the front of the church, there is the stone rosette, which probably dates back to the earlier church and the niches in which there is the bronze sculpture of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the work of the famous Croatian contemporary sculptor Marija Ujević Galetović."

126,Milna,Sacral heritage,"Church of St. George (Bobovišća) The construction of St. George began in 1656 and ended in 1696, as is documented by the inscription on the stone doorpost, found in front of today's parish church. At the end of the 19th century the old church was torn down and in 1914 a new church was built, which still exists today. Church of St. Martin (Bobovišća) Church of St. Martin was built on the hill between Bobovišća and Milna in a strategically important position with the view of the waters from Split Gates to islands Hvar and Vis. This single nave church with a semicircular apse and its proportions and shape embodies the qualities of mature pre-Romanesque design. The simple stone façade at the top has a triangular gable dating from the 14th century. The church features a semicircular ceiling, and the walls are divided by wide shallow niches. Above the altar is a Renaissance stone relief, from the workshop of Niccolo Fiorentino, with the depiction of St. Martin on horseback with a beggar. Church of St. Martin is a protected cultural heritage of the Republic of Croatia. Church of St. John and Paul (Ložišća) Church of Saints John and Paul was built in 1820. It has a baroque façade and a stone court in front of the church. The most prominent part of the church is the ornate bell tower designed by the prominent Croatian sculptor Ivan Rendić and built in 1899. Ložišća villagers invited the then renowned Brač architect and sculptor to design the new bell tower for their church. Rendić showed up to the meeting with a bag full of various bell tower drawings, most of them simple and ordinary in design. However, as he was flipping through the drawings, the one depicting today's bell tower showed up and the locals immediately stopped him: ""This is the one we want!"", they said resolutely. Rendić laughed and said, ""You can neither make this bell, nor afford it, this one is meant for Venice."" It was those words that ignited the infamous Dalmatian defiance in them: ""Oh, is that right?! You think we can't? Now you'll see."" And so in the entire village took out loans that they spent years paying back in wine and olive oil. Nevertheless, they accomplished what they set their minds to. Church of Our Lady of the Annunciation, Milna Built in 1783 in Baroque style, the church is adorned with an ornate façade and stone steps leading up to the church. The tall stone bell tower is older than the church itself and was erected in the 16th century. At the top of the upper floor, there are 8 stone mascaron heads on the semicircular arches of the bell tower. What is noteworthy about the parish church is that it was built as a whole - it has not been expanded, built upon or restored, so it is proportionate, harmonious and beautiful. Within the church is the sacristy, the original church of St. Mary, built in 1519, and later beautifully integrated into the parish church by the architect. The interior of the church has the character of a cathedral, full of light, with seven marble altars carrying valuable paintings, works of Venetian painters. The most valuable are the one attributed to Sebastian Ricca and the second one which depicts the Assumption of Mary, on the back of which is written ""Paolo Veronese pixit 1500"". The church also houses an organ made in 1822 by the Callido brothers of Italy. The Church of Our Lady of the Annunciation is a culturally protected heritage of the Republic of Croatia. Church of St. Joseph, Osibova Bay Osibova is a bay south of Milna. This small and quiet double bay offers somewhat odd shelter from the winds and is home to two churches. St. Joseph's Church is a wide single-nave structure with an extended semicircular apse adorned with classicist style stone elements. The church was built by the Brotherhood of St. Joseph in 1869. The main altar features a 17th century altarpiece with the image of St. Joseph, a donation by the Zadar archbishop Vicko Zmajević."
126,Milna,Our Lady of Seven Sorrows Church and Cemetery,"In the early 19th century, under Napoleon's rule, burial on church grounds and in settlements was prohibited all across Dlamatia. And so in 1880 Milna cemetery was relocated and an octagonal mausoleum-style church dedicated to the Lady of Seven Sorrows was built. Burial of the dead in the newly built cemetery began in 1895. Initially it was enclosed by a plain stone wall, and later a high wall was built in 1898. The cemetery is positioned on an elevation, on the opposite side of the bay, in a way that faces the town and the entrance to the cemetery ""is looking at"" the entrance to the parish church. Such a position on the high ground, ""cross facing a cross"", creates the effect of the holiness and (spiritual) elevation of the last resting place. The position of the cemetery, with its main northern façade overlooking the town and the parish church, is an example of neoclassicist concept of connecting spaces visually and infrastructurally. Church of St. John the Baptist Historically and architecturally immensely valuable restored church of Sv. John the Baptist with Gothic elements, used to be simply called the Old Church. It was built in the 14th century in the transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. It was renovated in 1994 with the help of Juraj Buzolić from Milna. It holds valuable Baroque reliefs of the renowned sculptor Matko Mijić. Church of St. Jerome At the beginning of the Pantera bay were once a shipyard and a slipway owned by Mate Bonačić-Protti, son of late Prosper. In 1860, his son Jere commissioned building a small church in the Banjić area, with the permission of the Archbishop. He dedicated the church to his patron saint, St. Jerome. Church of St. Nicholas At the entrance to the harbor of Milna, on the right, there is a church dedicated to St. Nicholas, patron saint of sailors. It was built in 1844 by Arne Harašić, landowner from Milna, for the spiritual needs of the locals and to the great joy of the sailors who were using the Vlaška Bay to shelter from stormy weather. For several years he urged the bishop, the municipality and the authorities in Supetar to allow him to build a church. He spent over 600 forints on it. He also endowed the church with a piece of land called Platac, with a vineyard and an olive grove. On the Feast of St. Nicholas the church holds a celebration, especially honored by the seamen of Milna. Church of Our Lady of Lourdes (Podhume) In their day, Podhume were mostly inhabited by shepherds. In 1898, at their request of the people of Milna, the parish priest petitioned the Bishop of Hvar for permission to build a small church in which God's service could be performed. The bishop asked for all possible permits, plans and sources of funding. Neither the pastor nor the people could meet these episcopal requirements. The pleadings were repeated several times, but to no avail. In 1925, however, a church was built in honor of Our Lady of Lourdes thanks to the people of Milna and the brothers of the late Mihovil Marangunić. In 1962 the church was consecrated, and since then the locals have been making pilgrimages to Podhume every year on the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, February 11th."
126,Milna,Church on the Islet of Mrdulja,"On the islet of Mrduja with a diameter of nearly half a kilometre and a height of 9 metres, situated between the islands of Brač and Šolta, there is a mediaeval church with a tower. On the corner of the front of the building, there is a pilaster with an elongated cross engraved on it. The arms of the cross are wider towards the end, and there is a rectangular protrusion in the middle. The church - fort is visible when passing through Split Gate /Splitska vrata/ by boat, and it has been masterfully constructed as a combination of a church and fort. According to its interior and construction of its walls, it has been dated to the Late Renaissance. This church - fort, together with the Baterija fort on Zaglav cape, was of great strategic importance during the 16th and 17th century, the period when fierce battles between the Venetians and Ottomans were waged. After the fall of the Republic of Venice, these forts once again came in handy as a defence from the Russian occupation of Brač in 1807."
126,Milna,Trivia,"Shipwreck in Lučice At the location near the bay of Lučice, on the southwest coast of the island of Brač, lie the remains of the iron wreck of a sunken steamship. Due to the size of the site and the abundance of small inventory from the ship, the site represents an important source for the study of the equipment of steam ships from the 19th century, and the steamer itself possesses characteristics essential for the valorisation and study of the typologically-structural elements of steam ships in general. Witches in Witch's Port The bottom of a beautiful bay on the western side of the island of Brač, which branches into several smaller bays, is the perfect place for sheltering ships from all kinds of bad weather. The largest of these bays is Vičja luka (Vještičja luka, Witch's Port), which gave rise to many superstitions and legends. It is believed to be the place where witches dance and gather at night, and also that it is connected by secret underground canals to the notorious Vičja jama (Vještičja jama, Witch's Pit) on Vidova gora. The most famous legend is the one involving a pair of oxen who fell into Vičja jama, after which their yoke emerged in Vičja luka after some time."
126,Milna,Vitalac,"Since ancient times, it has been believed that Bobovišće was the first place where legumes and broad beans arrived, and also that the vitalac, an Ancient Greek dish, arrived at Brač via Witch's Port, where four prehistoric graves covered with stone slabs were discovered, featuring multiple burials and a rich collection of grave goods from the Illyrian Greek civilisation."
126,Milna,Shepherd Loda,"Shepherd Loda, real name Anton Sapunar, born on 20 September 1895 to mother Vica and father Petar, was one of eleven brothers and sisters and lived in Ložišće. He is the topic of the eponymous novel written by famous Croatian writer Vladimir Nazor, but who was he in real life? He was low in stature, almost a midget, and mentally on the slow side. He lived in Ložišće with his sister Haramina, near the bell tower. He came to Milna once a year, always for the feast. As he was of cheerful spirit, everyone would gather around him, especially the children. He had the mind of a child of five or six, never went to school and could not read and write, but he knew several rhymes that he had learned from Vladimir Nazor. Whenever the children asked him to sing, he would climb on a small table or column and recite the rhymes. They would give him a coin afterwards and he would be very grateful. After the war, the feasts were no longer as well organised as they had been before, as they were of religious character, and as such efforts were made to suppress them. Nevertheless, this did not stop Loda from coming. During this period, he would always appear in a trenchcoat, even though it was midsummer. When someone asked him where he got his trenchcoat, he would say with great pride: ""Our poet Nazor sent it to me, Vladimir Nazor gave it to me."" And he always had a smile on his face ... He died on 06 April 1975 and was buried at the local cemetery in Ložišće."
126,Milna,Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel,"Feast day of the Parish and the Municipality of Milna. Our Lady of Mount Carmel is named after Mount Carmel in Israel. This day is accompanied by religious, cultural and entertainment events. The most ceremonial moment is certainly the solemn mass held in the afternoon hours, followed by a traditional procession. This is a solemn procession of believers carrying statues, relics, flags and candles, all accompanied by prayer and religious songs."
126,Milna,Kalaton,"The word kalaton is a portmanteau of the words marathon and kala, and these two terms form the basis of this sporting competition. The kalaton was born from the desire to familiarise the participants with the town in which the race is held through active participation, and to create different running routes that, by their very structure, make the competition more interesting from a physical and cultural point of view. "" Kala "" means street in the Dalmatian dialect, and the word is used to refer to the narrow stone streets that can be found in old Dalmatian settlements, most of which are not accessible by car. In the settlement Milna on Brač, where Kalaton was born, there is a main promenade and a series of kalas that interconnect different parts of the settlement, and all of them have access to the waterfront. The route of Kalaton is laid out by choosing the kalas that connect the old settlements with the new ones. The Kalaton passes by the school, church and other cultural landmarks, connecting the interior of the town with the coastline, from start to finish. In this way, participants are introduced to the history of the town in a completely different way. The kalas vary between themselves - some are concrete and some are cobbled, while others have an earthen or stone surface. This allows the participants to discover the many old and new ways of paving streets. The routes have many segments, some of which are flat, while others are uphill. The routes often include stairs, which makes the competition more challenging, but also at the same time more interesting. The Kalaton is held in August and is especially appealing to foreign tourists, who see it as an interesting way of sightseeing. The Kalaton is divided into a competitive part and an evening entertainment programme for the participants. The competitive part consists of a children's Kalaton for children under 13, and an adult competition."
126,Milna,Mrduja Tug of War,"Located in the Split Channel, west of Brač and east of Šolta, the islet of Mrduja is the eternal reason for the quarrels of the inhabitants of these two islands. Since ancient times, there has existed a legend on attempts to gain ownership of this islet. The initiative to revive the legend of the Mrduja Tug of War and finally get an answer to the question ""Whose is Mrduja?"" came from both islands, and it was eagerly welcomed by the inhabitants and guests of Brač and Šolta. This is how the Mrduja Tug of War became the central event of the summers of Šolta and Milna."
126,Milna,Milna,"Milna is one of the most architecturally harmonious examples of Baroque urbanism on the Dalmatian coast. It is the best natural port on the island of Brač, one that provided a safe harbour for the emperor's fleet during the construction of the Diocletian's Palace in Split. The bay in which Milna is nestled branches into two sleeves - Žalo and Pantera. Located in the western part of the island of Brač, the bay provides safety and shelter from all winds which makes it one of the safest known bays for charter boats in the summer season. Milna is located in the west part of the island some 18 kilometres away from the island's main hub of Supetar. It became the most important port on the island of Brač and it held this prestigious title for two centuries. Ložišća This modest and architecturally harmonious village characterised by steep cobbled streets has managed to splendidly preserve its rural features. It is dominated by the spindly and ornamented belfry built in 1889 as per the drawings of the sculptor Ivan Rendić. Ložišća is one of the youngest settlements on the island of Brač, dating back to the 18th century. It is also known as Velo selo as it was settled by the people of Bobovišće, known as Malo selo. After the parish church was erected, a slim belfry was built by the sculptor Ivan Rendić (1886-1889), and this masterpiece is the dominant feature of the settlement. The church was built in 1820, while the belfry was completed in 1899. Although the remnants of the chapel of Our Lady of Stomorica from the 12th century were found, this locality is believed to have previously been uninhabited. Since the very beginnings of the village to present day, the inhabitants of Ložišća have engaged in the cultivation of vines and olives."
126,Milna,Podhume,"The hamlet of Podhume is located in the vicinity of Milna. The courtyards, buildings, wells, wine cellars, furnaces and gardens of Podhume represent a lasting testimony to the authentic architecture of Brač. In 1925, a small church was built in honour of Our Lady of Lourdes which was consecrated in 1962. From that day until today, the people of Milna go on a pilgrimage on her feast day in February 11 to Podhume. The pristine nature and local delicacies from the nearby family farm will leave you speechless. We also suggest you try your luck in the game of balote played in the centre of the village. Bobovišća Bobovišća is located in the west of the island of Brač, only 2.3 km away from Ložišća, on the road to Milna. The village was developed after a persistent fight for secession from Milna parish in 1687. It was then that they got a chaplain and in 1750 it became an independent parish. From the secession document, it is evident that Bobovišća was also called Stanac Dolac. In 1674, together with Ložišće, this village had a total of 220 inhabitants. Bobovišća has a rich history as witnessed by the Parish Church of St George from the 17th century and medieval church of St Martin. Bobovišća na moru Bobovišća na moru is a small village which was founded as a port for the nearby villages of Ložišća and Bobovišća, which are located some 2 km away in the hinterland. The history of Bobovišća na moru can be traced back to the era of the Illyrians and Greeks. The village is located at the lower end of a beautiful bay on the western side of the island of Brač, which branches into several smaller bays which provide an ideal shelter from bad weather for all boats. The largest of these bays is Vičja luka (Vještičja luka, the Witch's Port) which gave rise to many superstitions and legends. It is believed to be the place where witches dance and gather at night, and also that it is connected by secret underground canals to the notorious Vičja jama (Vještičja jama, Witch's Pit) on Vidova gora. The most famous legend is the one involving a pair of oxen who fell into Vičja jama and their yoke appeared in Vičja luka. This autochthonous village attracts an increasing number of tourists who spend their summers in Bobovišća na moru."
127,Mljet,Mljet,"The island of Mljet is one of the Southern Dalmatia islands. It stretches parallel along the eastern half of the Pelješac peninsula, separated from Mljet by the 8 km wide Mljet Canal. Mljet has an overall length of 37 km with the average width of 3 km and a total surface area of 100.4 km2. The highest peak on the island is Veliki Grad with an altitude of 514 meters a.s.l. and it is located in the centre of the island, above Babino Polje. The characteristics of the Mediterranean climate are apparent at Mljet, with its dry, sunny and very warm summers, and rainy but mild winters, with a majority of rainfall coming near the end of fall and in the start of winter. It is an island of lush Mediterranean vegetation, clear and clean sea, picturesque bays and rich sea life. People who visit this historical and beautiful island characterized by pure nature fall in love with it and often return. Due to its specific geographic location and soil structure, Mljet has lush vegetation mostly consisting of the Aleppo pine (around the Veliko and Malo jezero, the village of Goveđari, the bay of Pomena, the hills of Bugari and Gaja, the bay and field of Sutmihalj) and the holly oak, with particulary well preserved forests at the locations of Valakija, Planjak, Kneže polje, Ivanje polje and Nikin dolac. There are also anthropogenically degraded forms of vegetation such as shrubland, garrigue and rocky grounds. The animals of the island are beech marten, Herman's tortoise, fat dormouse, East-European hedgehog, numerous birds such as the European honey buzzard, the European shag and the tawny owl, invasive species such as the small Asian mongoose and boars, and several types of snakes and lizards. Mljet has mostly managed to preserve its natural origins and authenticity thanks to its geographical location and the fact that it is separated from land. Sea, strong waves, sea currents and wind formed the structure of the Mljet coast as we know it today - filled with bays, caves, steep coves and rocks. The island was formed by rising from the sea, so it only forms part of the land from which it is separated. The sea around the coast of Mljet is warmer and saltier than it is in the north of the Adriatic. During winter, sea is colder only in bays stretching deeper in the land and in the lakes of Mljet. During summer, the sea is warm enough to swim in it, and its temperature is 2-3 °C higher along the coast, in the bays and especially in the lakes of Mljet than it is on the open sea. During intense summer heats, due to lush vegetation and clean air, even the hottest days are enjoyable. The benefits of the sea and vegetation can be felt all over the island. There are several freshwater springs on Mljet, as well as pools of brackish water."
127,Mljet,Visit the unique geological phenomenon in the Mljet National park,"The fascinating system of salt lakes, a unique geological and oceanographic karst phenomenon, is significant not only in our country but also in the world. The Great Lake with an area of 145 hectares and depth of up to 46 meters and the Small Lake with an area of 24 hectares and depth of up to 29 meters, with their beauty but also many undiscovered secrets, have attracted scientists and other curious people, especially tourists. On the open sea side, through a barely visible Soline canal, the sea is drawn into the body of the island, creating first the Great, and then through an even narrower canal, the Little Lake. Although they are formed by sea water, they are perceived as lakes in the landscape, so the population called them that. In the middle of the Great Lake there is another natural, cultural-historical and tourist treat - the picturesque Isle of St. Mary with a church and a Benedictine monastery dating from the 12th century. Due to its exceptional aesthetic atmosphere and strong spiritual and cultural dimension, the islet is a kind of symbol of the island and the Mljet National Park. There is a road around the Great Lake that can be used for walking, running or cycling. In the blue of these unique phenomena, you can take a swim as well as ride kayaks and learn first-hand why the lakes are called the jewel of the Mljet National Park."
127,Mljet,The wondrous heritage of a mystical islet,"On the island of St. Mary, in the southern part of the Great Lake of Mljet, there is a Benedictine monastery with the church of St. Mary. It was built in the period from 1177 to 1198. The Benedictines first built a monastery on the islet and then a church. History of the monastery extends as far as 1198 when the Pope Innocent III issued a document consecrating the Church of Saint Mary on the isle of the same name in the Great Lake on the island of Mljet. The Benedictines organised the monastery in accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict. For a long time, the Benedictines were taking a good care of the island and lived in harmony with nature praising God. In 1345, the Benedictines renounced their rule over a part of the island therefore Mljet obtained a Statute and municipality in Babino Polje. Formally, it was annexed by the Republic of Ragusa in 1410. The monastery continued with its activities until 1809, when it was closed during the rule of Napoleon. From that time on, the island had a number of different owners. The monastery property was governed by the state, and the monastery became more and more neglected. In 1960, the monastery was converted into a hotel and was opened until 1991. In 1998, the dilapidated monastery was given back to the Diocese of Dubrovnik. Within the monastery now there is a restaurant, pizzeria and a souvenir shop."

There are also anthropogenically degraded forms of vegetation such as shrubland, garrigue and rocky grounds.

127,Mljet,National park Mljet - safe harbor for all sailors,"With its beauty, the Mljet National Park has become an attractive destination for yachts, sailboats and luxury mega yachts. The possibility of anchoring and mooring in the Mljet National Park exists in two bays Pomena and Polače. Polače Bay is one of the safest and largest bays in this area. It owes its status to the islands of Kobrava, Tajnik, Moračnik and Ovrata, which with their position protect the bay from any wind and provide security to all ships in the bay, both in winter and summer. Every year, more and more sailors recognize Mljet as a top destination to come, as visitors can enjoy absolute anonymity, as well as the beautiful landscape that surrounds them on all sides."
127,Mljet,Roman palace in the National park Mljet,"Rimljani u zaljevu Polače tijekom 3. stoljeća počinju graditi impozantnu palaču u kojoj je stolovao rimski upravitelj ovog posjeda. Palača je imala i obrambenu funkciju o čemu svjedoče dvije jake kule na njezinim krajevima. Uz palaču su tokom vremena izgrađene i dvije ranokršćanske bazilike i terme, što ukazuje da je u palači, osim upravitelja živjelo i svećenstvo, a to nam govori da je Polače u ono vrijeme živjelo i funkcioniralo kao kasnoantički, odnosno ranosrednjovjekovni grad. Romans in the Gulf Polače during the third century began to build an imposing mansion in which dwelt the Roman governor of this land. The palace also had a defensive function, as evidenced by two strong towers at its end. Besides the palace, over time, two early Christian basilicas and baths were built, which indicates that clergy lived in the palace, beside the governor, and functioned as a late antique or early medieval city. Except of many archeological monuments, the underwater of Polače is rich with many hydroarchaelogical sites. These sites hide a lost tresure such as antique amphoras, ceramic dishes and shipwrecks."
128,Mošćenička Draga,The Past and the Culture,"The small church of St. Petar counts among the beginnings of culture of this region. It is situated in the settlement of St. Petar, still preserving the ruins of an abbey. An interesting detail of the ruins is a stone receptacle for holy water from 1573 with a glagolithic inscription. Mošćenice, a medieval town above Mošćenička Draga, and the St. Ivan Beach is closely linked to the glagolithic tradition. The town is mentioned in the period of Slavic colonization - the Croats came here in the 7th and 8th century A.D., occupying the lands that formerly belonged to the pre-Roman tribe of the Liburnians. After settling down, the new inhabitants quickly discovered the possibility of survival in this idyllic stretch of land at the foot of the mountain, which they named after their God of Thunder, Perun. Perun is linked to Trebišće, a village hidden from the sun, banished to exist in eternal shade and to spend its fairytale historic life in bygone times. Along with Mošćenice, there is Brseč - a typical medieval town erected on cliffs, 157 m above the bay of Kvarner. The first written traces date back to the year 1102, when the place was inhabited long before all other settlements. This is witnessed by the Sisol hill with its prehistoric castle and signs of civilization and life dating from the late antiquity.

The legend says that margrave Engelbert of Istria and his wife countess Matilda were buried in the older church. The present-day church of St. Stephen was built between 1580 and 1614, obtaining its current shape at the end of the 18th century.

The Kaldir parish was established in 1550, probably for the inhabitants that arrived in the village after fleeing the Croatian lands occupied by the Turks."

133,Nijemci,Fishing in the Municipality of Nijemci,"Rivers Bosut and Spačva are rich with freshwater fish such as carp, perch and pike, which makes them a favorite fishing place for sports anglers. River Bosut flows through the area of the Municipality Nijemci through the settlements Nijemci, Podgrađe, Apševci and Lipovac, and the inhabitants have always lived and worked near the river and from the river Bosut. Rich in flora and fauna, it additionally enriches the beauty of the area near the river. Due to its tame course it is suitable for all types of vessels. River Bosut is rich in freshwater fish and therefore a favorite among the anglers. The story goes that the ancient Romans spoke of a river in their empire that flows in one direction in the morning and in the other in the afternoon; the river is Bosut, sometimes it flows so peacefully that even the slightest wind can change its direction. River Spačva flows through the Spačva pool, the largest complete oak tree forest. Spačva is, next to Bosut, extremely important for irrigation and keeping of oak forest, as the oak demands a large quantity of water. It is very rich in fish what both the anglers and nature lovers appreciate. The area around Spačva river is wetland which is favorable for oak tree and many fish types (carp, perch, pike, catfish) and it is their natural hatchery. In the area of the Municipality Nijemci there are a couple of fishing clubs which organize numerous sports competitions, and one of the most famous is Sports competition in float fishing within the manifestation ,,Divan je kićeni Srijem"". Sacral heritage and museum ,,Luka Natali"" The parish of Nijemci is mentioned as early as 1332. In the 17th century the parish of Nijemci had 10 villages with 2500 Catholics. Today, the parish of Nijemci, in addition to Nijemci, has only two branches, Donje Novo Selo and Đeletovci. The church in Nijemci is dedicated to St. Catherine of Alexandria. It was built before the arrival of the Turks and is mentioned as early as the 15th century. It has been renovated and arranged several times, but even today it stands proudly on the right bank of the river Bosut where parishioners perform their rites and it is a very important sacral monument. Parish Church of St. Catherine, built on the bank of the river Bosut, on an extremely beautiful prehistoric site Gradina, with a school example of a preserved moat, is a very valuable cultural and historical monument. It was built in the 14th century. According to archaeological research, the church had its Romanesque predecessor. It was located on the site of today''s church. Beneath the present floor two more floor levels have been discovered, in the right-hand corner in front of the apse the remains of Roman architecture. During the excavations, graves were discovered on the rows of the Bjelobrdo culture, as well as the remains of a monumental building from the earlier phase. Probably the builders of that first church were the LOTHARD family who were then the owners of the settlement Nijemci. The second (today''s) church was built in the early 15th century and was in the Gothic style. The Gothic church also sat on the former Bjelobrdo cemetery, and the area around it functioned in the late Middle Ages as a local cemetery. In addition, it is assumed that it was at this place, in the center of today''s Nijemci, that the medieval fortress and market town of Nijemci were located. The third change in the style of the church is the Baroque. The baroque change of the church was carried out by priests serving in Nijemci, Don Luka and Andrija Natali. This happened at the beginning of the 18th century and has remained so to this day. It was destroyed in the war but was rebuilt after the end of the war. In Đeletovci, the church is dedicated to St. John Capistrano, and was built in the 19th century, in 1872. In Donje Novo Selo, the church is dedicated to the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. It was built in 1868. The settlement of Lipovac was named after a linden tree. In the form of Lypowcz it was recorded in 1484 when it belonged to the town of Morović. It is located south of Nijemci, on flat ground on the left side of the Bosut. Church of St. Luke, popularly called Our Lady of Lučica is located 3 km west of the village Lipovac. The church itself is located in a beautiful natural environment. Namely, the church and the entire area around it are surrounded, in the length of about 2 km, by a tributary of the river Spačva called Luka. It is believed that the arm did not completely close the area around Lučica, but that it was dug up and connected to Spačva by the builders of the monastery or church of Lučica, in order to protect themselves from possible attacks and robberies. There are several interpretations about the name of the church, but it is most likely that the church was named after the image of St. Luke, who, after painting the Virgin, was amazed by its beauty. The time of its origin cannot yet be determined with certainty, and it has also not yet been confirmed whether the church was the original building or was built on pre-existing foundations. Namely, the appearance and traces that are visible of the church belong to the Gothic style, which would mean that it was built in the late 13th or early 14th century, but there is no coincidence that part of the building material used to build the church does not belong to that period. According to the research of the pastor Meštrović (the end of the 19th century) and his records, it is possible that Lučica existed even from the time of the Crusade wars, which would mean that the construction started between the 11th and 12th century This is supported by the fact that there was a Templar monastery next to the church Lučica, and it is known that the Templars were at the head of the crusader army. Today, this fact is confirmed by the cross, or rather its shape, which was a sign of recognition of the Templar monastery. It is a single-nave Gothic church with a polygonal apse and a characteristic wooden bell tower. According to sources, there was first the Templar monastery, and then the Franciscan monastery, which was demolished with the arrival of the Turks. It was first renovated in the 19th century and underwent a thorough renovation during the time of Bishop Strossmayer, when the Gothic windows and the south door were walled up, and it received a flat roof. During the Homeland War it was on the battlefield line and got a direct hit into the apse. After the war, church Lučica was in a very poor condition. The bell tower of the church as well as the roof were considerably damaged, and the wall on its south side was pierced by a grenade. The interior of the church was completely destroyed, both by the detonation of grenades and by the consequences of the leak. As this is a high value cultural monument (zero category), the Ministry of Culture started the project of renovation and restoration of the Sanctuary of the Lady of Lučica in 2000. For the feast of the Assumption, members of cultural and artistic societies come here from all over Syrmia and Slavonia. Native museum „Luka Natali"" is located in Pastoral center of parish Nijemci in the center of Nijemci. The museum was named after the Belgrade bishop, general pastor in Syrmia and archpriest of Pecs diocese, and apostle pastor of the countries under the Ottoman siege, Luka Natali, who sat in Nijemci in the 17th and 18th century, and where he was buried. There you can find everything from the founding of the settlement, Middle Age to modern history and Homeland War. Within the museum, there is an ethnic room, also known as ,,Bakina soba"" (Grandmother's room) arranged in traditional style with details from the past which show how people used to live in this area."

134,Nin,Roman house with the most representative mosaic on the Croatian coast,"The remains of a rich Roman house were found in Nin with extraordinarily preserved mosaic floors. The locality has been researched and is preserved, with a project being implemented within a pavilion of the mosaic that will soon be presented to the public. A representative locality of antiquity is located in Nin - remains of an urban villa with extraordinarily preserved floor mosaics. The locality is situated to the east from the Roman Forum, in the area of Banovac, where remains of a wealthy Roman house from the end of the 1st and beginning of the 2nd cent. A.D. have been discovered. On a surface area of more than 1000 m2 there is a large peristyle with a well, a series of rooms, bathrooms, heating plant, kitchen, dining room and atrium. Several rooms have preserved black and white floor mosaics of high technical quality and an interesting decorative and artistic repertoire. There is a floor mosaic dating from the 2nd century. The rarely seen mosaic consists of geometric and vegetable motifs, and there are eight attractive medallions depicting animals in the central room. The mosaic carpet has an extremely rich pattern on which geometric and vegetable ornaments and medallions with animal depictions (dog, boar, wild boar, deer, wolf...) are shown. The elaborate mosaic is framed with a black edging, on a white background it is provided in a composition in which motifs alternate in horizontal and vertical sequence. The mosaic carpet is framed by two edgings, the outer one with a herringbone motif and the inner one formed by a series of semi circles and semi squares filled with three rods, and a white braid on a black background. The site has been examined and protected, and a project is being implemented to present the findings to the public in a better way. On that same site, findings from earlier periods give the conclusion that in the Liburnian period there was also a representative building, as evidenced by small fragments of Greek painted pottery from the 3rd century B.C. The Roman villa collapsed in the 8th century, and within its walls, Croats built their own houses to live in. It is the central room of the villa that has the most representative mosaic of 8 × 7 m, one of the best preserved and best made and so far found mosaic on the east coast of the Adriatic."
134,Nin,The oldest tobacco factory on the Adriatic,"The monumental entrance, popularly called the triumphal arch, is a testimony to the economic complex built for the production of tobacco in Nin in the 18th century, and also that of sparkling wine. The remains of the oldest tobacco factory in Dalmatia are located at a distance of 2 kilometers east from Nin center. In 1786, Marquis Jerolim Manfrin erected the most modern economic complex of the time with factory buildings in the city of Nin. The fertile fields of the tobacco plantation offered good yields. Inside the factory, a small production of sparkling wine was initiated. For the needs of the estate, a pier for larger ships was organized, and it is assumed that at the beginning of the 19th century there were 30 medium and small ships. Experts from Italy and Albania were brought in to teach the locals everything about tobacco production and modern agriculture. At the beginning of the 19th century, the present-day locality of Grbe developed on the remains of buildings, former residential and commercial areas. The mentioned complex consisted of stables for 120 head of cattle,18 horses, a hay stack, warehouse, workshop, houses for field workers, yard with a cistern, a big yard, church, lodgings for the chaplain, lodgings for the physician, a kitchen for islanders, inn, blacksmith's shop, bakery, lodgings for the owner, lodgings for the scribe and the cashier, tenant's lodgings and under which was the police guard, while under the owner's lodgings there was a hospital. The nobility lived outside Nin and mainly in Zadar. They tried to extract as much as possible economic profit from the leased land without respecting the rights of workers, thus the dissatisfaction of workers was reflected in causing the failure of the great complex. After the fall of the Venetian Republic, the Manfrin Estate soon ceased to exist. Consequently, the Austrian government did not do much for the economy of the Nin region. The ancient port of Nin (Aenona) The ancient port of old Nin, then called Aenona, is located in the Zadar Canal on Cape Kremenjača. Nin was a strong maritime and trade center since the 9th cent. B.C. and an important port on the eastern Adriatic. The Illyrian tribe, the Liburnians, founded the city named Aenona that had an important role in the trade of the time. In Roman times, the name of the city was Enona, and in the Middle Ages that Constantine Porfirogenet (Porphyrogenitus) called it Nona from which derived the name Nin. The remains of the Roman port Aenona (Roman Nina) are found on Cape Kremenjača along the shoreline called Bilotinjak on the Zadar Canal shores. The port was at a distance of 1.5 km from the settlement of Aenone, on an islet in the Nin Lagoon. Transport took place by land.The remains of a Roman port are being systematically explored. Significant are the submarine findings of vessels Serilia Liburnica from the 1st century hiding in the sand in the sea. The cargo from one Serilia and a copy of one part of such vessel are exhibited in the Nin Museum of Antiquities. The ancient port of old Nin is one of the largest, and according to its findings, one of the richest port areas on the eastern Adriatic. During low tide, remains of a breakwater and ancient walls from the 1st cent. B.C. can be seen on Cape Kremenjača."
134,Nin,The Church of saint Ambrose - heavenly protector of Nin,"The Romanesque-Gothic church of St. Ambrose from the 13th century is dedicated to the deacon St Ambrose, the companion of Bishop St. Anselm - one of the seventy-two disciples of Christ with whom he spread the Gospel in the Croatian regions. The church structure is a sigle-naved church with Romanesque-Gothic features, 13.82 x 5.86 m, with a rectangular sanctuary. It was built from finely carved white stone and stands near the Town Gate. In the 15th century, the church of St. Ambrose was rebuilt, and expanded. The monastery and the church were destroyed by the Turks at the beginning of the 16th century. The powers (bones) of St. Ambrose are kept in the Nin Church Treasury, where the bones of all Nin saints are kept in reliquaries. The monastery church from the 13th century dedicated to the deacon of St. Ambrose is one of three preserved churches out of the 12 from the Middle Ages located on a small area of 15 ha, on the historic island of Nin. The deacon St. Ambrose along with St. Marcel assisted in the apostolic performance of Bishop St Anselme, the founder of the ancient Nin church. Tradition says he was one of the seventy-two disciples of Jesus. In addition to these saints, St. Ambrose is one of the three heavenly protectors of the city of Nin. Research discovered that in the 10th century next to the church there was a Benedictine monastery where the second oldest Benedictine abbey on Croatian soil was founded. The facade of the church has the characteristics of Romanesque construction with a simple entrance portal. There is an opening in the shape of a cross above the portal and over it a narrow Romanesque window. The single-nave area was vaulted with a semi-cylindrical tufa vault, and the church was reinforced with two belts on the inside. The remains in the foundations are proof that the church had a semicircled apse. A fragment of the sanctuary fence with the name of Prince Branimir and Abbot Theodobert originates from the church of St. Ambrose. The present rectangular apse, measuring 5 x 4 meters, was built later. The present shape of the church dates from the renovation of 1992. Mass is served in the church from time to time and, due to its exceptional acoustics, concerts are also held in the church."
134,Nin,Crowning site of seven Croatian kings,"The Romanesque church of St. Nicholas is the recognizable symbol of Nin accompanied by the folk tradition on the crowning of seven kings. On this site, the newly crowned ruler would cut down all four corners of the world with his sword, confirming the kingdom in Croatia. The church of St. Nicholas, together with the church of the Holy Cross dating from the 9th cent. are two exceptionally valuable examples of preserved sacral structures in the wider Mediterranean area. That symbol of ancient Nin - the first capital of Croats is situated in the center of Prahulje crowning filed. The church was built on an earthen mound resembling a small hill in the midst of a flat area. This place is the most common scene for photos from weddings, short visits or vacations. The church, with its central ground plan in the shape of a trefoil and a cross-ribbed vault, was built at the beginning of the 12th century. During the period of the Venetian-Turkish wars (16th/17th cent.), a crowning site with 8 merlons was added to the church, so today it resembles a fortress. The church attracts with its mysterious site and romantic appearance. Experience here the most magical sunsets and moments to be remembered for a lifetime."
134,Nin,The smallest cathedral in the world - Croatian Stonehenge,"The church is located in very center of the historical islet of the city of Nin - the oldest Croatian royal city and the cradle of Croatian culture. The church of the Holy Cross was recognized as the smallest cathedral in the world named by the English architect Thomas Graham Jackson in the 19th century. It is one of the few buildings that has managed to withstand the great destruction of the city of Nin through turbulent times. A unique sacral building of an interesting central type with a ground plan in the shape of an irregular one-armed Greek cross, it was built on the remains of Roman buildings (1st-6th century) visible in its surroundings. It is 7.80 m in length and 7.60 m in width, with a height of 8.20 m (interior measure), and 57 cm thick walls. The church building has a beautiful lintel decorated with plaited ornaments, and the simple interior has only a small part of the visible frescoes from the 13th century. During the time of Croatian rulers, it served as the court chapel of a nearby prince, and later of the royal court. Many medieval graves have been discovered in the vicinity of the church. The laws of arithmetic, physics and astronomy were used in its construction, and it was built to be used as a sundial and calendar. The special openings on the church building used as windows let the sun's rays for the equinox and solstice into the interior, and they paint and determine the time of day and the beginning of the seasons. Thanks to the position of its windows and the angle of incidence of the sunrays, this makes it easy to determine the spring and autumn equinox and the summer and winter solstice. The church of St. Nicholas from the beginning of the 12th century and the church of the Holy Cross from the 9th century are extremely valuable preserved cultural monuments unique in Croatia and the wider Mediterranean. The church is a kind of museum, and by the good will of the city authorities, it is open all year round and all day with free admission for visitors. A representation of the church of the Holy Cross is on the flag and coat of arms of Zadar County, so it is a kind of symbol of the region. The artistic Festival of Sun and Light has been taking place for more than a decade on the first day of summer. At that time of the day, the sun is very high and the church itself receives the least amount of light. The sun then reflects its light on the floor of the church between 10:00 am and 12:30 pm, so the sun's path of light can be easily followed during that time. Due to the peculiarities of its construction and significance in relation to the sun, some call it the Croatian Stonehenge."

134,Nin,The Monument to Bishop Grgur of Nin,"You have probably heard that Nin has one of the ten world symbols of good luck?! The big toe for good luck on the statue of Bishop Grgur of Nin A visit of Nin is not complete if the big toe of Grgur of Nin is not touched and good luck summoned. According to that custom, Nin has one of the ten world symbols of good luck. Grgur of Nin, one of the most beloved Croatian bishops, presided from approximately year 900 to 929. During that time, he was famous for being the main advocate of the Old Croatian language and the national Glagolitic alphabet and Glagolitic worship. Bishop Grgur of Nin had the leading supreme ecclesiastical authority in the state of Croatia 925 when Tomislav (Thomas) was proclaimed Croatian king. Grgur, at that time, was the head of the Croatian church that bore the name of Church of Nin. Grgur of Nin is the most beloved Croatian bishop for advocating the use of the Old Croatian language and the Glagolitic alphabet. At the First Church Council held in 925 in Split, he struggled, together with King Tomislav, for worship to be in the Croatian (Slavic) language and for the use of the Glagolitic alphabet. To avoid a schism, Tomislav supported the interpretation of the historical law of the Salonitan church. Thus Bishop Grgur was left without a diocese and metropolis. At the Second Church Council held in 928 in Split, the diocese of Nin was abolished, the diocese of Skradin was assigned to Bishop Grgur, and no records have been found of him since. Church authority over the Croatian Church was handed over to the Archbishop of Split. Latin became the official liturgical language, and the ordination of priests who served Mass in the Old Croatian language was forbidden. There were few priests with the knowledge of Latin, so God's service continued in Old Croatian with the use of the Glagolitic alphabet in many parts of Croatia. In all three cities, he big toe of the famous bishop seems gilded due to the frequent touches of those who seek good luck and the realization of their desires. Sculptor Ivan Meštrović made three original bronze statues of bishop Grgur of Nin. One statue was placed in Nin in 1969 near the Church of St. Anselme at the celebration of the 900th anniversary of the issuance of the charter of Croatian King Petar Krešimir IV, where the term Mare Nostrum (our sea) appeared for the first time as proof of the king's rule over land and sea. The other two statues were earlier placed in Varaždin ad Split. The worn-out big toe of Bishop Grgur's monument is one of the world's ten symbols of good luck!"

134,Nin,The old Croatian vessel Condura Croatica,"Valuable monuments of the Croatian maritime heritage are the recognizable vessels of Condura Croatica from the 11th century found in the port of Nin and connected to the rule of King Krešimir IV and King Zvonimir. The three-thousand-year-long historical story of Nin speaks of prosperity based on salt, trade and a long maritime tradition. While the antiquity period of Nin was marked by the vessel Serilia Liburnica, the Old Croatian period was marked by vessels Sagena that still have not been found and the discovered Conduras. According to the description of Emperor Constantine Porfirogenet from the 10th cent., it can be concluded that the Old Croatian war navy had about eighty vessels and they were the smallest but deadliest war vessels in world history, which were otherwise used for trade. According to findings, the found Condure vessels sailed at the end of the 11 th and the beginning of the 12th century. They were narrow vessels built in the classical manner with ribs and formwork joined by wooden and iron nails, 7 to 8 meters long. They were used as fast rowing boats, and in case of favorable wind, a square sail was raised. These vessels were built and sailed during the time of the Croatian rulers Krešimir IV and King Zvonimir. Historical records state that King Tomislav had 15,000 rowers ready for the Conduras, and other sources say that during the time of King Krešimir IV Croatia had as many as 20,000 rowers on such vessels. Two vessels were discovered in 1966, and taken out of the sea in 1974, and, following desalinization, conservation and restauration, they were exhibited in the Nin Museum of Antiquities. Two replicas of such vessel have been made, one is anchored in the Nin port next to the Lower Bridge and the second in Foša Port in Zadar.

The traditional name of the modern vessel is ""plazulja"", and it is the modest heir of Serilia and Condura of ancient Nin."

138,Novalja,Caska Cove,"The area of the Caska Bay is interesting for all archeology, history and historical phenomena enthusiasts. Caska is located on the western part of the Pag Bay in the vicinity of Novalja. This small location rich in history once was the area of Cissa, a Roman town, which according to historians sunk below sea level in the 4th century after an earthquake. Numerous studies have shown that it was a big and important city. Caska's importance is confirmed by the fact that there was a luxurious villa of a well-known and wealthy senatorial family from Rome - Calpurnia. But there is still not enough evidence to determine whether Caska was actually a Roman town or it had developed much earlier. Caska Bay today has only a few houses left, but its seabed keeps a secret - a sunken city. A perfect place of divers who can find remains of buildings. Unfortunately, the biggest part of the sunken city is out of reach because of large deposits of silt, sand and seaweed. Important historical landmarks of the location include the old „tunera"" - tuna tower and the remains of the Romanesque St. Georges Church on a hill above Caska with a large number of medieval and early Christian spoils."
138,Novalja,Tunera,"Not far from the small Church of St. Anthony (Sv. Anton) aits a round stone tower for observing the movements of tuna. The tower, which was built by Palčić family in 1888, is known as the tunera/ turan (tuna tower). Its peculiarity piques the curiosity of visitors and today it has become a sort of symbol for Caska. In contrast to the many wooden structures along the Croatian coast, the Tunera is the only such tower made from stone. The local poet Radoslav Dabo mentions two other tunera along the coastline of Caska, the main one in the Klopotnica cove and an auxiliary one on the point between Caska and Zrće, If they did exist, they were probably made from wood. The lucrative tuna fishing in Caska and Zrće lasted until 1960. In the distant past long, narrow boats called ladve were udes for this purpose. They were made from a single piece of wood and sometimes increased in size by adding lateral planks. They would be navigated with oars set in a long outrigger joist called a jaram or igo. Ladve are no longer in use today, although Gjuro Szabo observed them in the Caska region in the 1930s, when they had completely disappeared from ude in other regions. Fortress and Church of St. George (Sv. Juraj) At the top of the St. George hill above Caska there are remnants of a medival fort, which may have originated in late antiquity, possibly in the sixth century during the times of the Byzantine emperor Justinian and his wars against the Eastern Goths. Justinian was attempting to retain the re-established Byzantine rule along the eastern coastline of the Adriatic by building a uniform fortification system to ensure the security of the sea routes and the peaceful supply of the Byzantine fleet. Judging by the visible remnants, the fort had a rectangular shape. At its southeastern corner the small Church of St. George was built. The present day church originates most likely from the fourteenth century. However, it may have been built on the remains of another sacral building. Its walls were decorated with several architectural fragments with early Christian and pre-Romanesque ornaments, which were forcibly removed after the small church was deserted. Luckily, some of them found their way into the collection Stomorica, exhibited on the premises of the parish of the parish rectory in Novalja. These are fragments of stone furniture originating from the ninth century. . The single-naved Church of St. George had a semicircle apse sunken into the wall mass and was divided into two bays spanned by cross vault, with a stone roof made of panels. It was first mentioned in 1451, while in 1804, the last procession to Caska from Novalja began. In 1822, the mass was still celebrated here, after which it was left for the passage of time to take its toll. In 2006, the wxisting condition of and archaeological research in the fort and church began to be recorded. This effort led to the discovery of a complex of walls from an earlier building phase and the medieval grave of a dmall girl decorated in rich jewelry, consitsting of a silver ring with a crown, bronze necklace and a pair of bronze earrings."
138,Novalja,Cultural Heritage,"Among them are 3 early Christian basilicas from the 4th and 5th centuries; the remains of the floor mosaic of one of these basilicas can be seen within the Gothic church of Our Lady of the Rosary in the town centre. Many fragments of church furniture and other similar items are preserved in an archaeological collection called Stomorica. The Reliquary, found by one of the basilicas and now located in the Zadar Archaeological Museum, is also very valuable. One of the oldest illustrations of Our Lady with the inscription Maria ever found on the east coast of the Adriatic was found here in Novalja. In archaeological terms, the area of Caska is especially interesting and there have recently been investigations of the Roman settlement of Cisse, which legend says collapsed in an earthquake in the 4th century. A unique aqueduct carved out of solid rock dating back to the 1st century and measuring 1042 m in length, 70 cm in width and 9 overhead openings up to 40 m in height, is one of the most interesting and valuable sites in the area. This one-of-a-kind Roman aqueduct, popularly known as the Italian's Hole, once supplied Novalja with water from the Novalja fields. The entrance to this water supply system is located inside the Town Museum, which boasts a range of Novalja's cultural and ethnological heritage."

With its picturesque scenery and rich historical and cultural heritage, Novi Marof offers a unique tourist experience to every by-passer and visitor. Novi Marof is the hometown of several famous people from the past and the present. The tame hills of Novi Marof were home to famous painters like Mirko Rački, Ivan Rabuzin, Franjo Klopotan; and the lives of many other famous people were somehow connected to Novi Marof. It is enough to mention the names of the famous artist Oton Iveković, writers and politicians Mirko Bogović and Antun Nemčić, as well as Countess Luisa Erdӧdy, a great benefactor and a pioneer of healthcare in Novi Marof. It is believed that the town Novi Marof was established in the middle of the 17th century when Nikola III Patačić won new estates in his military actions. Furthermore, there is a belief that the Erdӧdy family was responsible for the creation of Novi Marof. According to it, Novi Marof was established by the last owners of fort Grebengrad, who built their „home"" on an estate around which a settlement began growing in the middle of the 18th century. Newer research has confirmed that the oldest mention of Novi Marof is tied to a document dating from 1664, found in the Varaždin State Archive, where Aleksandar Erdӧdy was stated as the owner of the Novi Maroff seu Lepen estate. The estate mentioned in the document was the aristocratic curia in the village Lepenje (today called Podevčevo). The Novi Maroff estate was mentioned in the manuscript of the Status familie Patachich repertory from 1666 so it can be concluded that these two families were responsible for the development of Novi Marof."

Old town The old town of Novi Vinodolski, with its stone-built houses and narrow streets, is a place steeped in history where people have lived for centuries. This is attested to by the parish Church of St Philip and James, with its rich interior and distinctive tall bell tower. The old church had a belfry on its roof until 1909-1911. After that, a new bell tower that was separate from the church was built, and the old belfry was demolished. The votive Church of Saints Fabian and Sebastian was built on the spot of the present bell tower in 1551. Legend has it that the people built this church in just 24 hours to protect themselves from the plague, which in this period devastated the area on several occasions. Next to it, there is the Church of the Holy Trinity with its valuable sacral collection.

The Novi Vinodolski Riviera, characterised by a Mediterranean climate with mild and pleasant, warm sunny summers, is an ideal starting point for exploring the Kvarner islands thanks to its location at the heart of Kvarner Bay and its good traffic connections with major European centres and international airports.

Carnival customs begin on the Thursday three weeks before Ash Wednesday in the Catholic calendar. From the first Thursday to Ash Wednesday, there are numerous events accompanied by a whole range of local customs, dances and specially prepared food and drink.

The Sunday after the first Thursday is the ""Wedding of Mesopust's Bride"", announced by the older wedding guests, in which all the participants are men dressed in men's and women's folk costumes. The wedding takes place in one of the town's inns. The culmination of the carnival begins after the third Thursday, on the night of Carnival Saturday, when people make and baptise the MESOPUST, a straw puppet representing a well-dressed man with a handsome face and a semi-cylindrical hat on his head. The puppet sits on a chair and is taken to the wall of the castle, above the square where people dance the kolo. He will be imprisoned and eventually convicted."
140,Novi Vinodolski,Novljansko kolo circle dance,"Visit us at this most cheerful time of the year! Perhaps the most impressive part of the carnival folk customs is the Novljansko kolo circle dance.

The dancers alternate three steps: senjski, arbanaški and poskočica. The dance continues until the evening hours and is joined by many local inhabitants.

140,Novi Vinodolski,The Wine Rose of Vinodol,"According to this story, at the end of the harvest, the most beautiful and diligent girl in the vineyard was chosen as the Ružica (""Wine Rose""). She would receive a vine crown and lead the procession to the town accompanied by ancient folk instruments. According to records, this event took place for the last time in 1880.

According to legend, Queen Elizabeth Kotromanić and her daughter Mary were imprisoned in the fortress of Novigrad from 1386-1387. During her imprisonment, it is said that Queen Elizabeth embroidered a golden royal cloak, later known as chasuble - worn by Catholic priests. The garment is still preserved in the Birth of the Blessed Virgin Mary church in Novigrad. Whilst wanting nothing more than a male heir, Queen Elizabeth only ever gave birth to four daughters. However, her burning desire for a male heir resulted in the creation of St Simeon's Shrine, which can be found in the church of St. Simeon in Zadar."

141,Novigrad Sea,Fortress Fortica - Castrum Novum,"A Croatian fortification of the ličko-krbavska great lords, once the lords of Novigrad, dominates the town from the steep hill. Constructed on a hill-fort from the Illyrian period (2,000-1,000 B.C.), at the beginning of the 13th century, there was a renewed Roman tower on that same spot, and it was called Castrum Novum (out of which derives the first name of Novigrad).  At the end of the 13th century (1282), the ličko-krbavska lords Gusići - Kurjakovići thoroughly reconstructed the fortress to protect their property in and around Novigrad. In 1386 the Hungaro-Croatian Queen Mary and her mother Elizabeth, a widow of the Hungaro-Croatian king Ludovic I of Anjou and daughter of the Bosnian Ban Stjepan II Kotomanić, were imprisoned there.  When the Venetians took over Novigrad in 1409, the fortress was reinforced and expanded, transforming it into a castle. The fortification was almost impregnable for 150 years, from the beginning of the 16th century to the mid-17th century. However, the Turks succeeded in conquering it in 1646 but only managed to keep it under their rule for nine months when it was again liberated. The fortress was last restored in 1708 and abandoned after the fall of the Venetian Republic in 1797."

Renovated in 1974, just the site of it hovering above the turquoise water is a peaceful escape for both your body and spirit. Legend has it that back in the day, extreme weather conditions caused by strong ""bura"" winds created chaos amongst fishermen who were quickly thrown about at sea. They washed up at this same beach, to everyone's disbelief, safe and sound.  Thankful for surviving the violent storm, the fishermen built the Church of the Holy Spirit, which still stands today. Above the entrance of the church door, a bell tower is incorporated into the façade for a bell kept within the church. The bell doesn't contain any inscriptions or embellishments, and it is only used on Whit Monday, also known as Pentecost Monday. This is when Posedarje celebrates the day of its municipality. It is traditionally marked by a procession of boats to the small island, where a holy mass is held within the early Romanesque church. This event is a true vision to behold and has an increasing number of visitors from surrounding areas each year."

Each morning they would set off to the unknown in a hope to return to the port safely. Many things have changed since then, but Mandrač and fishermen with their ships are still here. You can see them in the early morning hours cleaning their fishing nets, sorting through the catch or simply chatting away the morning.

145,Ogulin,Ogulin,"Ogulin may be a small town, however, its hospitality and the rich features that it offers are large. When you visit Ogulin for a break it will easily take up a whole day. To help you choose the attractions and possibilities we'll list them one by one. When we talk about Ogulin, the most recognisable symbol is the Frankopan tower. It is important because it played an important role in the origin and history of the town itself, and it connects one important point with another important point in the town. The fortress was built on the cliff 30 metres below which the River Dobra sinks underground, and down there it connects to a cave system under the town. The image is impressive, as is the story that is connected to the origin and development of the town. If we start from the tower, the path is clearly marked to go further. The Heritage Museum has been located in the tower since 1967. The town was built by Bernardin Frankopan, and you can find out more about the history of the town in the excellent permanent exhibition in the museum. Within the fortress complex is the multimedia visitor centre of Ivana's House of Fairy Tales. At the site of the old Ogulin library there is a museum that celebrates fairy tales and their authors from all around the world, thanks to Ivana Brlić Mažuranić, who was inspired to write her most famous work, Croatian Tales of Long Ago, by her homeland, Ogulin. We think you will easily understand why this town is so special in these two museums. So, come and see for yourself. As the town is also neatly arranged, we recommend that you stroll to King Tomislav Park. The park was originally established and landscaped back in the 18th century, and it took on its present appearance in the 20th century. From the air, it has the shape of a diamond, in the centre of which is a cross that leads to the church. The baroque Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is open for visitors from morning to dusk. The rich inventory and interesting and original frescos are just part of the story of the baroque Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. Lime trees adorn the whole park as well as the whole town. Along the avenue of lime trees are benches, so it is pleasant to sit in the park and watch and listen to how the life of the people of Ogulin flows. Pay attention to the way they speak! All the Croatian dialects bubble under the surface in the speech of the local people! In the Park there two classicist monuments (you will easily notice them), one was erected upon the 1,000th anniversary of the Croatian kingdom, whilst the other was erected in honour of Ogulin's first water supply system. Walking through the town, you will find out that there are legends connected to Cesarovac, Đula's abyss and Klek mountain. There is also an explanation about how the town got its name. You can hear about them in the interpretation of a narrator and professional storyteller. Don't forget that you are on the Fairy Tale Route - the route that combines the creative work of Ivana Brlić Mažuranić with the places in the town that inspired her in the writing of her Croatian Tales from Long Ago. Art installations have been set up around the town and the surroundings, so look out for unusual shapes and discover what they reveal about the place where you are. The local cuisine offers traditional dishes such as the Ogulin ""masnica"" with onions, eggs and cream, plus pickled cabbage, local types of cheese, honey products from local family-run farms, fruit and berry produce, pancakes and sweets from local confectioners, along with the picturesque terraces of cafes, are enough to create your own image of a small urban town in the heart of Croatia."
145,Ogulin,Via Dinarica smaragd path,"If there is anything simple, then it is to be active in Ogulin! The town that is located in a spacious valley, in the heart of continental Croatia, is best known to nature lovers for Klek mountain. This is understandable because the idea for the first national mountaineering association emerged on Klek in 1874. From whichever side you approach its 1,181-metre-high peak it is reminiscent of a sleeping giant. This is why there are famous legends about Klek's witches and Slavic gods. The road to Klek leads from Ogulin to the village of Bjelsko where there is a marked mountain path. When you reach the board with the inscription Dobrodošli u carstvo klečkih vještica (Welcome to the Empire of Klek''s Witches) you are already at 1,000 metres above sea level, at the foot of the peak of Klek. Here you will find a small mountain lodge that is open at weekends. There is still half an hour's climb until you reach the flat rocky top with a view that is worth every drop of sweat! If you are not in the mood or fit enough for climbing and heights then there are two wild rivers in the spacious valley: the Dobra and the Zagorska Mrežnica. On the River Dobra is Lake Bukovnik, to which a wonderful green path leads from the town Ogulin that you can walk down alongside the Dobra all the way from the canyon to the lake. On the Zagorska Mrežnica River is the Sabljaci Lake. At Sabljaci is the Sabljaci Camp, a new modern campsite with 26 plots. A variety of outdoor activities are available at Sabljaci Lake: cycling, sailing, walking, swimming and fishing. You can hire SUP boards and bicycles at the Sabljaci campsite. At the start of the lake, there is a restaurant where apart from traditional dishes there is also a large choice of pasta. If you want to stay all weekend, apartments and holiday homes are an option. Have an active break, beside the clean rivers, picturesque mountains and accompanying gastronomic treats. In Ogulin, this is simple!"

145,Ogulin,Ogulin is the perfect place for a family day trip,"Halfway between Zagreb and Rijeka and only two hours from Zadar, is the town of Ogulin. You are probably aware that when you come to Ogulin, you are coming to a hilly landscape where rivers, small waterfalls, underground streams and wide landscaped meadows meander alongside the rivers, lakes or below the mountain. So a reminder that a ball, trainers, a blanket, a frisbee, a badminton set and all other kinds of gear that you can use to fill your free time on one or more of Ogulin's green areas will be very handy here. The centre of the town subtly offers all the tourist infrastructure that you need for a trip. Once you arrive, first take a refreshing break in the Hotel Frankopan that is located in the very centre of the town. You can easily recognise the centre of the town because two towers rise high into the air and invite you to come closer. Human imagination, as well as the necessity and strategy of our wise ancestors, built a fortress right on the cliff above the spot where the River Dobra drops beneath the ground - today the centre of the town, long ago in 1500. At that time, the fortress had a strategic defensive function, and it served it well because since its beginnings and through history Ogulin has never been conquered by any army. Over the constant course of time, the fortress has lost its defensive purpose, and fortunately, in the present day, it now houses two museums. Homeland Museum with many exhibits worth seeing, and Ivana's fairytale house - a multimedia and interactive center for visitors. When you walk through the old part of the town, you will get to know the old history in a new guise, it is the time to get to know the town and see for yourself the intertwinement of the historical heritage with the natural beauty of the region. It will become quite clear to you what Ivana Brlić Mažuranić, who was born in Ogulin, had in mind whilst she wrote the fairy tale Reygoch. The rest of your time can be spent playing ball, with frisbees and relaxing on blankets for the start of a story. Only 4 km from the town is Sabljaci Lake. Alongside the lake are mown and landscaped paths that invite you to play or just relax. And so that you don't miss out on ice cream, right at the start of the lake is a restaurant that along with various dishes also offers ice cream throughout the summer. Ogulin is waiting for you!"

Just like the entire Central Dalmatia, which is criss-crossed by trails for two-wheeled adventure enthusiasts, in recent years Okrug positioned itself as a great cyclotourist destination. Moreover, it is one of the host cities of the attractive Cro Race, whose third stage - the 165 km long section from Okrug to Makarska - started precisely in Okrug Gornji. The great news is that you can also try this and other Okrug routes - not only will they offer you a challenge in terms of the varying complexity of the terrain, but due to the iconic Okrug attractions you encounter along the way, you will be also able to combine cycling with sightseeing! Čiovo bike trail 1 For example, if you take the Čiovo bike trail 1 (Trogir - Mastrinka - Arbanija - Slatine - Rudine - Žedno - Okrug Gornji - Čiovo - Trogir), you will discover the oldest island settlement and the former eremitic refuge - the village of Žedno and the ancient church of Saint Maurus - a centuries-old gathering place for hermits; and a ride along the coast will give you a great view of Kaštela and the opportunity for a pleasant break on small pebble beaches. If you conquer the ascent from Slatine to the right in the direction of Rudine, to the highest peak of the island, reward yourself with a magnificent view of the entire northern side of the island and the Kaštela bay! Čiovo bike trail 2 You can also take a tour of the picturesque church of Saint Maurus as a part of the Čiovo bike trail 2 (Arbanija - Žedno - Rudine - Vrh - Slatine - Arbanija). After conquering the 1.5 km long asphalt ascent to the village of Žedno, follow the forest path through macchia and olive groves, which can also be mastered by bike with some caution and skill! This trail is a true feast for the eyes - in addition to the beautiful views of the western part of the island of Čiovo and the Drvenik channel archipelago, you can also indulge in the scents of island vegetation and in a drive through gardens and olive groves! Čiovo bike trail 3 The Čiovo bike trail 3 (Slatine - Mirine - Gospe od Prizdinice (Glava) - Prisoje - Slatine) is a real challenge - except for riding along the coast and the asphalt road, in some parts it is necessary to push, and even carry your bike! But, a beautiful viewpoint that offers a unique view of the city of Split and its hinterland with Mosor and Biokovo mountains in the distance, and the idyllic eremitic sanctuary of Our Lady of Prizidnice from the 16th century in a beautiful natural setting, with an old monastery and a small church, enriched with votive boats, steep cliffs, deep blue sea, blooming agave and many species of native plants, are quite a motive enough to take this route for somewhat bolder and more experienced riders! Čiovo bike trail 4 The Čiovo bike trail 4 (Okrug Gornji - Okrug Donji - Gnjilovača - Labadusa - Okrug Gornji) will be a true delight to all the visitors eager to get to know Okrug on two wheels! The famous Toć beach - Copacabana, the 6th century church of Saint Theodore, enchanting views of Saldun, as well as the Trogir and Marina bay, the famous islands - the mysterious Fumija and the islet of Kraljevac right next to it, covered in thick forest, thus named because Bela IV, the King of Hungary and of Croatia, took refuge there during the Tatar invasion in the 13th century... are just some of the attractions you will encounter as you drive along this macadam-asphalt trail, including Okrug's favorite gastronomic hotspots - the well-known Duga tavern and Labadusa restaurant! Čiovo bike route 5 If you don't avoid technically demanding trails, try the Čiovo bike route 5 (Trogir - Okrug Gornji - Troglavica - Bušinci - M. Draga - Žedno - Trogir). In addition to the pleasant drive along Camp Rožac and Toć beach in Okrug Gornji, there will be sections that will literally require walking, but the rewarding sights - idyllic bays like Kancelirovac, Racetinovec, Mavarčica, Mala and Vela Draga will be - at your fingertips! The okrug beaches - warm, crystal clear seawater sounds (and looks) great! Crystal clear seawater with an average summer temperature of 23°C? If this sounds appealing to you, then Okrug is your place to be! There is a whole range of stunning beaches to choose from. When we say a whole range - please take it literally, because in Okrug there's a vast array of hidden and somewhat more accessible pebbly beauties - beaches Toć (Copacabana), Camping Rožac, Debeli Rožac, Rudej (Stari Porat), Planikovica, Tatinja, Rastići, Bušinci, Bočić and Vela Draga (Bila plaža), bays Racetinovac (Pantera), Kuzmića Bay, Krušica (Kava), Široka, Duga, Duboka (Labadusa) and Mavarčica, all make an ideal marine ambience to create new memories!

Just a little glance of this beach reveals similarities to its famous double - it's the epicentre of all daily and evening events, attracting numerous swimmers at daytime and party lovers and gastronomads at night! It is much loved by the youngest guests as well, who enjoy visiting nearby water parks, and simply by anyone who enjoys idyllic Mediterranean setting! Grab a seat at one of its beach bars and indulge the enchanting sunset, considered by many to be even more beautiful than the one in Zadar, which owes its global fame to the sharp director's eye of Alfred Hitchkok! And when it comes to sunbathing and swimming, find out why, despite summer heats, everyone is gladly heading to Čiovo! Camping in Okrug - discover your inner Robinson Crusoe! In addition to the true little oases of luxury - lavish vacation homes and stylishly furnished designer suites, opt for eqxuisite camping experience in camps ""Rožac"" and ""Labadusa""! Quality hospitality and amiability are the essential part of Okrug's long-term formula of success, as witnessed by satisfied guests who stayed at the resort no less than 10 years in a row! But, for a true Robinson experience and a profound connection with nature, why not try camping? There are two excellent camps on attractive locations at your disposal. Camp „Rožac"" Camp „Rožac"" delights its visitor with crystal clear sea and a long pebble beach combined with fragrant Mediterranean flora - a rich source of shade and relief from summer sun.

Experience a really special Christmas Eve! Did you know that the residents of Okrug nurture a very special holiday tradition? If your travels take you there at Christmas time - don't miss out on it! We believe you have come across all kinds of Christmas trees, but this one in Okrug is a little more special than the others. Lowering a neatly decorated Christmas tree under the sea surface by local divers became an intriguing tradition! A priest, also a diver, blesses the tree, and the whole event is accompanied with a favorite Dalmatian ""spice"" for every occasion - delicious traditional food! To celebrate this event, fascinating photos of the underwater Christmas tree are taken, and should they encourage you to visit Okrug during the holiday season, prepare for a great atmosphere, masterfully crafted bakalar (traditional cod stew) and local wine! Explore picturesque churches and intriguin historical remnants! If you adore sightseeing, you will be delighted with the fact that in addition to the proximity of Split and Trogir, Okrug itself offers its unique cultural and historical landmarks! Church of St. Theodore The picturesque church of the local patron saint, St. Theodore, will intrigue the visitor with the works of Venetian painters as well as unknown masters from the 18th century. Precisely such artwork can be noticed at the main altar of the church - the depiction of St. Theodore on a horse dressed in military equipment, killing a dragon; and of Trogir and Čiovo island in the background. The beginning of its construction may be traced as far back as the 6th century. Not only that its altar panels richly decorated with interlace pattern show skillful stonemasonry - they also suggest that in the past it was generously donated and fully equipped with luxurious church furniture. Church of St. Charles Borromeo The church of St. Charles Borromeo in Okrug Gornji was built around 1640 after one of the numerous epidemics of plague, probably as a small votive church. In time it started to gradually erode, so it had to be demolished, and in 1735, due to the efforts of locals and pastor Nikola Pavković, the existing, new and larger church was built. Within this church you can see intriguing examples of sacred art - pay attention to the painting by an unknown author with the depiction of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, St. John, St. Lawrence and St. Charles Borromeo on the wooden and carved altar. This artwork is an homage to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the patron saint of peace, which has been celebrated throughout Dalmatia since the end of 17th century, after major wars with Turks, as a sign of gratitude for the war successes and the achieved peace. Church of St. John the Baptist Did you know that in the past the island of Čiovo was one of the bastions of eremitic tradition? Its stone witnesses are the church of St. John the Baptist in Okrug Donji, dedicated to the hermit saint, and the remnants of the Benedictine monastery on the island of Fumija, which, because of its safe shelter and anchorage in the nearby Duga bay, water sources and smaller fertile land areas, was adequate for the organisation of the religious life of the Benedictine monks of Trogir. An idyllic Mediterranean setting and pristine nature have been attracting hermits since ancient times - they could devote themselves to their religion and spirituality in peace, so the eremitic tradition began there in the early centuries of Christianity. If you visit Duga bay - nowadays a well-known sailing destination - enjoy the view of this famous islet, and if you like sacral architecture, take a tour of the church of St. John the Baptist in Okrug Donji and admire its Late Renaissance-style features. Because of its secluded, but well-protected location, it is considered that the tower of St. John, built on the rocks at the Kancelirovac bay, is also an early Christian eremitic residence that was inherited by the Benedictines of Trogir. If you are a sightseeing enthusiast, you will be delighted to see this tower because of its massive, roughly carved stone squares typical of the Romanesque architecture and large arched windows."
146,Okrug,Racetini summer residence,"The remnants of the Racetini summer residence in the Pantera bay are no less impressive - it's a former country-farm estate from 1650 that belonged to the old noble family of Trogir. If you visit this bay, which is still a safe spot for wild anchoring, look at this fascinating building, which, in addition to the single-storey house, cistern, cultivated garden and orchard, nearby threshing floor, barn and courtyard, even had its own chapel dedicated to St. Anthony the Abbot!

Zadar, considered to be the birthplace of Croatian basketball and famous for the most delicious cherry variety ever, owes its charm to the specific atmosphere of a university town and amazing architectural gems - St. Donatus' Church, a truly monumental, round 9th century building from the pre-Romanesque period, St. Anastasia's Cathedral - the largest in entire Dalmatia, the ancient Roman Forum, the Citadel, the Landward Gate... More recent attractions include the unique Sea Organ and Greetings to the Sun! Dubrovnik is really hard to resist, and if you're a fan of the globally popular Game of Thrones series, it is time to book your bus ticket! Its lavish Baroque architecture that gave it the nickname of the Pearl of the Mediterranean (whose author is none other than the most celebrated English Romantic poet, Lord Byron!) and its impressive city walls, which, along with 18 other beautiful locations, have served countless times as a perfect filming spot for the aforementioned TV series, offer an unforgettable sightseeing experience! And as for sensations for the palate - try local delicacies like fresh shellfish straight out of the sea, zelena menestra - green stew, šporki marakuli - macaroni with a rich tomato and meat sauce, quince dessert - kotonjata and candied orange peel - arancini!

With its charming, UNESCO-protected historic core, Trogir, only a 3 km away, instantly reveals why it is called a city-museum! The cathedral with the well-known Portal of Master Radovan culturally and artistically relevant to the entire Adriatic basin, the 15th century City loggia, the Grand Čipiko palace, the City hall and the Benedictine monastery from 1064, are just some of the cultural treasures that blend perfectly into its truly incredible stylistic and architectural harmony. Split, 30 km away, also needs no special introduction - the monumental Diocletian''s Palace, its ancient cellars, the Cathedral of Sv. The Duje and its baptistery, the Peristyle and the Golden Gate, are all part of the wide array of attractions of this UNESCO gem that attracts guests from all over the world with unprecedented intensity. The popularity of Split grew even stronger because of the globally popular Game of Thrones TV series - if you are a fan of the series, look for the emblematic filming locations, such as the ancient fortress of Klis! And if you wan't to feel like one of the locals, join their favourite routines, such as strolling along the famous Marmont Street or sipping coffee on the Riva - city's favourite waterfront promenade! The ""youngest"" town in Croatia - nearby Solin - offers an additional portion of attractions. Take a tour of the remnants of the ancient Salona, which was the metropolis of the Roman province of Dalmatia - its Tusculum, city walls, Episcopal Center, Basilica, Town Baths - thermae, Baptistery, Porta Cesarea town gate and Amphitheatre, will be a true delight to every sightseeing enthusiast. And in the town of Solin itself, reward your senses with idyllic greenery of Our Lady's Islet (Gospin otok), and your palate with its traditional dishes - from trout broth and grilled eels, to the famous Queen Jelena's steak! Discover heavenly resorts for gastronomads and boaters! If your prefer spending your holidays at the open sea and you gladly pair your nautical experiences with sensations for the palate, then Okrug is an ideal choice for you! If you are in this group, choose your spot to anchor in the bays Duboka and Duga, or opt for wild anchoring in secluded, hidden gems like Široka, Pirčina and Racetinovac. Like living postcards with turquoise, crystal clear seawater, picturesque islets (such as St. Fumia with the remains of the late antique church!), and a beautiful pebble beach with only a few rocks scattered here and there, both Duboka and Duga bay boast some of the best gastronomic hotspots in the area. Tastefully decorated tavern in perfect accordance with the marine ambience, seafood freshly prepared on the grill in front of cuisine and superbly chosen pairing red and white local wines, are a great motive for anchoring in the Duga bay, whose visitors keep coming back for 12 years in a row! Gastronomic delights offered in Duboka bay are no less impressive. Visit the Labadusa tavern with its exquisite fish menu and fine wine labels, and the Laganini Beach Club that surely won't leave you indifferent - with its stone interior, sun loungers and comfortable outdoor seatings with white cushions, it is a perfect oasis to relax and unwind. If you don't avoid wild anchoring, in the Okrug area you will also find remote, but safe shelters for your vessels. In addition to Široka and Pirčina, we highly recommend Racetinovac bay - its sandy bottom with marine vegetation provides a very safe spot to anchor, and the stone remains of the Racetin noble family's mansion make it an intriguing sight with an authentic touch of history."

The marking of the Krk section of the Croatian Camino route, following the medieval pilgrimage paths of the island of Krk, took place between 2019 and 2021. The Krk Camino route, in a unique synthesis of contemplation and discovery of the island's natural, historical, and cultural treasures, follows almost entirely the contour of the island. On the first day, it leads from Krk to the village of Brzac (23 kilometers), the second day from Brzac to Malinska (22.9 kilometers), the third day from Malinska to Omišalj (19 kilometers), the fourth day from Omišalj to Čižići (21 kilometers), the fifth day from Čižići to Vrbnik (21.6 kilometers), the sixth day from Vrbnik to Baška (23.3 kilometers), and the final, seventh day from Baška to Kornić (21.4 kilometers). Besides many landmarks that pilgrims will encounter on their journey, one of the most significant examples of island's sacral architecture stands out in the context of the first day - the complex comprising the Cathedral and the dual church of St. Quirinus and St. Margaret in the center of the old town core of Krk. Pilgrim's Passport and Certificate All pilgrims who dare to embark on or complete the Camino Krk will receive a pilgrim's passport or ""Credential del Peregrino,"" as well as an official document certifying their pilgrimage, known as a pilgrim's certificate or ""Compostela.""

147,Omišalj,Memorial House of Krk Folklore,"A collection of the tangible and intangible heritage of the island of Krk. The so-called Kuća na stupićih (House with balustrades), which was built in the early 20th century, houses an exhibition featuring the traditional folk costume, items of daily use, and local musical heritage. This place is dedicated to the Festival of Krk Folklore, which was established in the first half of the 20th century (Omišalj, 1935) and which is the oldest event of its type in Croatia."
147,Omišalj,Lapidarium,"A collection of stone monuments from the area of the Municipality of Omišalj. This collection of movable cultural assets makes up an in situ exhibition together with the monuments located in its immediate vicinity, especially those outside and inside the Collegiate Church of the Assumption of Mary. The inscription about the construction of the water supply for the ancient town of Fulfinum, which was located on the coast of Sepen Cove southwest of Omišalj, is particularly interesting. The inscription from the year 94 makes mention of the Emperor Domitian as the builder of the aqueduct. His name and title, as elsewhere in the Roman Empire, were officially erased by a decision of the Senate (damnatio memoriae) and removed from the surface of the stone inscription; what remains is the name of Lucius Sextis Dexter, a veteran of the Third Praetorian Cohort who, probably as an inhabitant of Fulfinum, made a donation towards some of the work on the aqueduct. Parts of the early medieval stone fittings from the early 9th-century church, which preceded the present Collegiate Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, are also worth mentioning. A tombstone slab with a Glagolitic inscription and a relief depicting the bishop's mitre and pastoral staff, dating back to 1477, is particularly interesting. It was made for Stjepan of Zadar, the last abbot of the Benedictine monastery of St. Nicholas, which was located in front of the entrance to Omišalj. The significance of these stone fragments and other parts of local heritage has been thoroughly explained in a booklet entitled Nepoznati Omišalj (The Unknown Omišalj), a cultural and historical guide that can be obtained at the exhibition venue. Loža (Loggia) A public building in Omišalj whose history dates back to the Renaissance. In the Renaissance period, the town loggia was located on the Placa square. Inside and in front of the loggia, local people used to trade, hold meetings, and choose their representatives in communal governing bodies in accordance with the autonomous powers which the Municipality of Omišalj, as a community of free commoners, had both under the rule of the Princes of Krk and the Republic of Venice. The loggia was the place where important decisions were made, such as the selection of those who had to serve on Venetian galleys, the backbone of the power of the Republic of Venice. The loggia was rebuilt in the early 20th century. ""Vid Omišljanin"" Library The library is named after a writer and illuminator who lived in the late 14th century. Omišalj town library is located in the municipal building, which was built in the period prior to World War One upon the ruins of the Frankapan castle. In 1396, Vid Omišljanin wrote and painted a breviary of 468 parchment sheets using uncial Glagolitic letters. He made it for the Parish Church of St. Bartholomew in Roč, a small town in central Istria. The breviary is kept in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. The first reading room was opened in Omišalj in 1884. It was moved to its present premises in 2002."
147,Omišalj,Glagolitic inscription,"A Glagolitic inscription of Matija Franović from the year 1535 - lintel of a portal, built into the house at Veli dvor 11 This Glagolitic inscription is inscribed in a medallion around a cross on a stone block built into the lower part of the façade of a house. The inscription mentions the priest Matija Franović and the year 1535. Originally, the inscription was not located in this rather undistinguished place. The stone block was the lintel of the portal of the rectory and the owner marked the completion of the building with an inscription and a cross, as was common practice in the Renaissance. This also had an apotropaic function, that is, to defend the house from evil. Nowhere in the world are there so many preserved Glagolitic stone inscriptions as on the island of Krk. These inscriptions attest to the fact that literacy was widespread among the ordinary inhabitants of the island. The most important role in this was played by the priests of the chapters of the small towns of Omišalj, Dobrinj, Vrbnik and Baška, which at the time were referred to as kašteli (castles)."
147,Omišalj,Gastronomy,"Krk's gastronomy is characterized by simplicity and wonderfully rich flavors. Alongside locally produced olive oil and wine vinegar, island dishes are typically enhanced by spices and ingredients readily found on the island, such as bay leaf, rosemary, garlic, spring onions, salt, parsley, tomatoes, olives, carrots, and more. Small blue fish, asparagus, homemade sheep cheese, and Krk lamb hold a special place on the menus. Fresh fish, scampi, and other shellfish remain irreplaceable in the islanders' cuisine, as do various vegetable side dishes. Holiday feasts almost always include dishes made from homemade dough (such as šurlice, macaroni, gnocchi) served with various sauces. Krk lamb, homemade sheep cheese, and prosciutto paired with authentic Krk Žlahtina wine are particularly prized."

147,Omišalj,Biserujka Cave,"Located on the border area between the municipalities of Omišalj and Dobrinj, not far from the village of Rudine on the island of Krk, is the Biserujka Cave. According to legend, Biserujka Cave (meaning ""pearl"") got its name from the treasure found inside, which belonged to local pirates. This harmonious karst cave, approximately 110 meters long, is rich in stalactites and stalagmites, and the bones of a large cave bear, estimated to be 16,000 years old, were found within it. The lowest point of the cave measures -13 meters, and the bottom of the cave is only 30 meters above sea level. It was renovated for visitors in 1997, and there is an entrance fee.

147,Omišalj,Parish Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"This three-aisled church was constructed at the turn of the 12th century in a Romanesque style. Parish Church in Omišalj hides a rich history of religious heritage, adorned with numerous scenes of Christianity painted by local artists. Side chapels, domes, and sacristies were added in the 16th and 17th centuries. The facade of the church is adorned with a rosette, a round, relief-decorated stone window with a Glagolitic inscription from 1405, often used as the emblem of the town of Omišalj. The bell tower was built over three years, from 1533 to 1536, and the funds for its construction were provided by the entire population of Omišalj and various brotherhoods. Constructed like a fortress, during those turbulent times of increasing threats from the Ottomans and conflicts between Austria and Venice, such a bell tower served not only a sacred role but also acted as a lookout post. Church of St. Anthony of Padua A single-nave church with a semi-circular apse. The Church of St. Anthony of Padua in Dubac was first mentioned in 1685. However, judging by its Romanesque building style, it must be significantly older. In the past, the Fraternity of St. Anthony of Padua used to take care of the church. In the southern wall, a Gothic window has been preserved. The altarpiece of St. Anthony of Padua dates from the 18th century. The building has a bell gable with a preserved bell. In front of the church, a spacious loggia was subsequently built. This is a favourite meeting place, especially in the evenings during the summer months. Church of St. Helen A single-nave church with a semi-circular apse (14th/15th century). The Church of St. Helen was built using layered stone blocks. Its façade features a Gothic portal with a pointed arch and a small cross-shaped window, and is crowned with a bell gable. The church is located next to the bell tower and loggia of the parish church, several steps above the Placa main square. It was first mentioned in 1458, by which time it was already a ruin. In that year, it was renovated and restored to its present state by Nikola Bozanić. In his will, dated 15 April 1470, he entrusted its care to his successors, together with the use of certain estates. Notarised documents from subsequent years provide evidence of several names from the Bozanić family who were connected with the chapel. A record from 1565 mentions Vid Bozanić as having jus patronatus, that is, the right of patronage over the chapel and its estate. The Omišalj priest Anton Bozanić, in his will of 16 August 1612, entrusted the cleric Anton Čubranić with the care of the chapel, under the condition that after his death the chapel should again revert to the Bozanić family. Inside the chapel, there is a stone altar and altarpiece to St. Helen. Holy mass on the feast day of St. Helen of the Cross is celebrated in the chapel. Apart from this one, there are also remnants of another, older small church dedicated to St. Helen in Omišalj. This church is known locally as Sveta Jelena na Dolu (St. Helen in the Valley)."
147,Omišalj,Bell tower,"A Renaissance bell tower, completed in 1536, which is attested to by a Glagolitic inscription above the entrance door. The bell tower was constructed over three years, from 1533 to 1536, and the financial means were provided by all the commoners and fraternities of Omišalj. These latter were religious associations engaged in charity work but were also the key drivers of construction activity when it came to sacral buildings in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Era. Two master builders were in charge of construction: Pjero of Omišalj and Andrij from the village of Kotor near Crikvenica. At that time, the priest of Omišalj was Matija Vlčijić, and the castellan was Nikola Antončić. Detailed information can be obtained from the Glagolitic inscription which the proud builders made above the bell tower portal. In the bifora (mullioned window) of the bell tower, the master builders integrated parts of the pre-Romanesque church fittings. The inscription on the bell tower reads: 1533, in the month of March, by the will of God and the Blessed Virgin Mary, and by the command of the priest Matija Vlčijić and the castellan Mikula Antončić, and the judges who were there at the time. All the commoners and fraternities helped build this bell tower. And it was done by the master builders: Master Pjero of Omišalj and Master Andrij of Kotor. And it was completed in May of 1536."
147,Omišalj,Rose window,"The church façade features an ornate circular rose window with a Glagolitic inscription from 1405. This rose window, a work by the proud master stonemason Sinoga of Omišalj, is often used as an emblem of the town of Omišalj."
147,Omišalj,Archaeological Park Mirine Fulfinum,"The Roman part of Omišalj is the most important part of its history, and the perfectly preserved example of a Roman town, ""Mirine Fulfinum,"" is Omišalj's greatest attraction. During July, you have the opportunity to become a Roman! The Municipium Flavium Fulfinum city is largely unexplored and unexcavated, and existing knowledge has already confirmed its status as a city. Its name is precisely known thanks to the discovery of an inscription from the time of the Roman emperor Domitian, which mentions some works on the city's aqueduct. The inscription is preserved in the Omišalj collection Lapidarium. The city is partially buried under dry stone walls and untouched Mediterranean nature and olive groves. The city consists of a forum that has changed its structure several times, a basilica, and a valuable sarcophagus in the gallery space at Mirine, taverns, numerous public buildings, tombs, baths, and an oil mill. The uniqueness of Mirine Fulfinum lies in its continuous settlement during the Roman era and early Christian history, all crowned by a valuable find - the Mirine Comb made of ivory, adorned on both sides with relief depictions of Christ's miracles. Kaštel (Castle) The location of the former tower of the medieval Frankapan fort. The south-eastern wall of the parish office features a preserved stone tablet with a Glagolitic inscription about the construction of the tower in the year 1476. The tower was erected by Ivan VII the Younger, the last ruler of the island from the Frankapan family. In later years, the former feudal residence of the Princes of Krk was administrated by the Republic of Venice as a fort with castellan before it became neglected in the 19th century. In the early 20th century, a school and complex of municipal buildings with rectory and parish office for the Omišalj priest were constructed in its place. Today, the seat of the Municipality of Omišalj is still here. The cistern from the central courtyard dates back to the Frankapan period; it was renovated at the beginning of the 20th century. The Glagolitic inscription about the construction of the castle on the wall of the parish office reads: In the name of God, amen. In June 1476, when the construction of this castle began during the reign of Prince Ivan and his son Mikula. Placa (town square) The heart of the historic centre of Omišalj. The Placa has for centuries been the centre of Omišalj. At the beginning of the 20th century, this function was gradually taken over by the area at the southern edge of the town, the site of the former castle, where the new municipal building was constructed before World War One. The houses that line the Placa possess traces of original medieval and Renaissance architecture, which are hidden beneath the building works, adaptations and renovations that occurred in the course of later centuries, especially during the 19th and early 20th century, when Omišalj was significantly reshaped."
148,Omiš,Brzet,"Still within walking distance from the old town, Brzet is one of the most popular beaches of the Omiš riviera. It will take you no longer than 15 minutes on foot to reach the pebble beaches of Brzet. If you get there on time, there are truly magnificent spots under the pine trees that offer shade throughout the day. But the best spots get occupied quickly so you better hurry ;)"
148,Omiš,Camp Galeb beach,"Besides Velika plaža, this is the only sandy beach in Omiš. Extremely popular among kids as there is a huge variety of activities at the beach and around it. There is also a windsurfing school on the beach for kids and adults."
148,Omiš,Nemira,"One of the biggest coastal villages on the Omiš riviera, Nemira's coast is basically one huge beach. It could be tricky to access the beach by car so we would recommend either walking or, even better, exploring the coast by boat. Stanići There is only one thing you need to know about the main beach in Stanići - THE most beautiful sunsets in Croatia. Because of its unique position, the sun shines over Stanići beach long after 8 PM during summer and if you are a fan of staying on the beach as long as possible - this is the place for you."
148,Omiš,Lokva Rogoznica,"Located just beneath the D-8 road, Lokva Rogoznica beaches are among the most accessible ones on the Omiš riviera. All you have to do is drive your car and pick a spot straight from the road. Sometimes that will be a cosy little beach you will share with others, but the real bingo is when you find a hidden cove where you can enjoy the sea and sun in absolute privacy. Medići In Medići you will find one of the most popular beaches in the area that attracts lots of locals. And who knows the best beaches better than the locals? There is a big parking lot just above the beach in Medići so it is easily accessible by car, although finding a parking space could prove tricky, especially on weekends."
148,Omiš,Mimice,"The most famous beaches in Mimice, equally popular among locals and visitors, are Juto and Kutleša beaches. Marušići If you are looking to spend the day in a peaceful and quiet environment, you can't go wrong with visiting Marušići. Although there are plenty of small beaches all around the village, the true hidden gem is the Borak cove. A beautiful sandy beach, pine trees reaching all the way to the sea and a natural spring that was used for centuries by local peasants."
148,Omiš,Pisak,"The most remote coastal village on the Riviera is Pisak and many say you simply can't get a better taste of truly clean sea than here. There is a small port in Pisak and, if you are lucky, there is a chance you'll meet local fishermen emptying their nets in the port. Near Pisak there is also the Vruja cove, according to many - one of the best places in Croatia for scuba diving or snorkelling. However, as often the case with truly unique places, Vruja is not easily accessible, so be prepared for some hiking if you are getting there by car. Once again, we would highly recommend visiting Vruja by boat as you will get to explore the entire Omiš Riviera coast on your trip there. 25 things you must see and do while on vacation in Omiš Omiš is so much more than just sea, sun and beautiful nature. We often hear travellers who have spent many summers in Omiš talk of having discovered some new incredible thing to see or do that they somehow missed before. Although Omiš is a small town, it takes time and effort to discover all of its gems, some well displayed, some hidden even better. While it is perfectly fine to spend your whole vacation just lying on the beach and relaxing - to fully capture the spirit of the town and its people and to be able to say you have truly been to Omiš - there are many things you must experience. Here's the full list, just for you: Things to do in Omiš - autumn Mountain trails, exploring the Cetina river canyon and the town's hinterland - there is no better time to embark on adventures like this than early autumn, while in late autumn there are seasonal activities such as picking olives by hand - a tradition more and more tourists are enjoying each year - especially when they come home with bottles of olive oil, an essential part of Dalmatian cuisine. Things to do in Omiš - spring It is the time of year perfect for outdoor activities and if you are feeling competitive there are plenty of cycling, hiking and trekking races you can participate in. Things to do in Omiš - summer"
148,Omiš,Relaxation and sunbathing,"Relaxation and sunbathing are the most obvious choices in hot summer days and also two of the main reasons why many tourists come to town. Virtually all of Omiš's riviera is suitable for swimming and sunbathing and a useful rule of thumb is - if you go south (in the direction of Makarska) you'll see pebble beaches, if you go west (to Split) you'll see sandy beaches."
148,Omiš,The Festival of Dalmatian klapa,"The Festival of Dalmatian klapa is a cultural trademark in Croatia and it takes place in Omiš during summer months so if you have a chance - definitely buy your ticket for a night of a cappella singing inscribed on the UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The Omiš Pirate Battle Things to do in Omiš - winter But then comes Christmas and Omiš suddenly becomes a place from a fairy tale. In a small town like this it is much easier to create the unique and warm Christmassy atmosphere where everything and everybody seems so jolly. Virtually every street of the 2000 years-old town is full of Christmas decorations and in December/January there is a Christmas fair with mulled wine, sausages, and live-band performances almost every night. While most towns in Croatia have Christmas fairs, it is not so common that the whole town is one big fair and it's just that small-town ""everyone knows everyone"" atmosphere that makes Omiš stand out in this time of the year."
148,Omiš,Dalmatia Ultra Trail,"DUT is a unique annual trail race starting from Omiš, with a changing route that leads across four mountains (Omiška Dinara, Biokovo, Mosor and Kozjak), three rivers (Cetina, Jadro, Žrnovnica) and a whole range of tourist attractions such as the Omiš Fortica or ancient Salona. And all this along mountain trails and long-forgotten paths that Dalmatian labourers for centuries used as the fastest connection between the Dalmatian hinterland and the sea. Over the last couple of years, thousands of runners from 40 different countries have participated in the race. It is important to note that, in addition to competitive routes, there are also those intended for recreational trail runners so that each DUT participant can choose their own path and pace. Running (and walking, of course) along the DUT trails, you will feel as if traveling through time, getting to know first-hand the authentic, hard-working, hospitable Dalmatia and its people."
148,Omiš,Klapa singing,"One of the most important reasons for this is by all means the famous Festival of the Dalmatian klapa, that during warm summer nights of July fills the streets and squares of the old town with pleasant sounds of authentic Dalmatian klapa music, recognized and protected as part UNESCO's world heritage. Its' notes softly permeating the old town's narrow alleyways remain the first thing many visitors will remember when thinking of the town on the Cetina River. The festival was founded in 1967 and has been taking place annually ever since, becoming, over the years, the central event in the world of klapa music. During the four summer weeks of the festival, Omiš is the world centre of amateur a cappella singing, attracting a growing number of singers from all over the map each year - from South America all the way to Africa and Australia! But although it is sung all over the world today, the origin of authentic klapa song is solely Dalmatian. It developed several hundreds of years ago from spontaneous gatherings of friends, who finished off their laughter- and wine-filled evenings with song. Over the decades, the klapa song grew more popular, klapa groups became more professional and the singers' voices more polished.  However, one key ingredient of true and authentic klapa song has remained the same throughout the centuries - it is never sung from the throat, but solely from one's heart.

Four centuries after the construction of the church, Opatija emerged as a holiday resort for the elite. The first holiday house in Opatija, the Villa Angiolina, was built by Iginio Scarpa back in 1844. This year is now officially considered as the beginning of tourism in the town. The Villa Angiolina played host to many famous historical figures, such as Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary, the Empress Maria Anna and the Croatian Ban Josip Jelačić. Forty years later, the first hotel on the Croatian Adriatic was opened, the Quarnero - today's Hotel Kvarner. It was constructed in only nine months. Great efforts were put into creating the image of Opatija as a fashionable health resort, and the town was compared to Nice in France. This was the time when the town's numerous magnificent villas, hotels, summer houses, bathing establishments, parks and promenades were built.

155,Osijek,Osijek,"The centre of Slavonia is known for its rich history, delicious food, spectacular landscapes and a dreamy river flowing through it. Osijek is a lively city with a friendliness of a local village, and a combination of classic sights, natural beauty and energy inviting you for a true adventure in the east of Croatia. Discover 10 reasons why locals love Osijek People of Osijek are famously hospitable and they will proudly guide you through their city''s streets and tell you a few local stories. We recommend you visit 10 things that every lover of the city on river Drava would show you. These are the things and places that locals enjoy seeing on their walks and they gladly often revisit them. Discover 10 reasons why locals love Osijek 1. Water gate and walls Magical baroque fortification, known as Tvrđa, is the pearl of the city that keeps many legends involving Austro-Hungarian soldiers, bastions, and powerful cannons. Tvrđa proudly reminds us of the famous history of the city. Many stories surround the Water gate that stands amidst the remaining walls, not to mention that this is locals' favorite spot for taking a romantic picture. 2. Osijek's parks In Croatia, Osijek is known for being one of the greenest cities, with the number of parks surpassing the number of squares. Take a walk in one of 17 parks that will offer you protection in winter, shield you from the sun in summer, or dazzle you with richness of colors in spring and fall. If you are going from Tvrđa to the center of the city, you will discover the names of three Croatian kings after which the three successive parks are named. Pay attention, some trees have a story to tell. 3. Secession sequence There are plenty of charming places in the city. Although a stroll through the promenade along Drava is an essential part of the local experience, those same locals will undoubtedly direct you to the most beautiful street in the city, European Avenue, in which you will find a sequence of buildings designed in secessionist style (early 20th century). They were built by Osijek's citizens who took in the culture and architectural trends of Austria and Hungary and poured their new ideas into these innovatively decorated buildings, that together form the secession sequence. 4. Co-cathedral of St Peter and Paul The imposing neo-Gothic church of St Peter and Paul, patron saints of the city, is one of the most valued symbol of the city. Its shape is deeply ingrained in the heart of every local. With its 90-metre spire, it looks after the citizens like a caring parent and invites passers-by to discover its impressive beauty and warmth within. Richly painted with frescoes and bathed in the rays of sun that come through stained glass, it inspires the visitors to look up and slow down their tempo in life. 5. Promenade Biking, walking, running, roller skating, coffee with friends, winter port. These are the words that the locals associate with their promenade along the river. If you take a walk along Drava, you will definitely start to feel like you are part of the town, and you will be greeted by many friendly faces and a sea of cyclists. 6. Pedestrian Bridge Pedestrian bridge is a hanging bridge that lights up during the night. Whether you decide to walk, bike or run, pay attention to the path that you can find by crossing the bridge. Most notably, you will discover that there is a beautiful view of the town from the center of the bridge. If you are there with a loved one, you might want to eternalize your love with a padlock. When you get to the other side of the river, you can check out Osijek''s beach and swimming pool area, the zoo, or the skate park where young and skilled bikers and skaters perfect their tricks for upcoming competitions. 7. River ferry There are few cities that pride themselves with the fact that they offer their citizens free and eco-friendly water vessel every day. The unique attraction in question is Osijek''s ferry that has been providing its services to generations of Osijek''s citizens in need of crossing the river, often to get to the zoo in front of which the ferry stops. This vehicle is not only pleasurable, but also useful because it only uses Drava''s flow to move, making it quite eco-friendly. 8. Zoo Biggest in size in Croatia and surrounded by peaceful nature, Osijek''s zoo probably has the happiest animals in the country, primarily because of the open space that they can freely use. In the zoo there are around 650 animals, and our youngest visitors are delighted to see chimpanzees, meerkats, lions, giraffes, and many other magnificent, wild animals. 9. Copacabana Summer days in Osijek would be unthinkable without a swim in the river Drava or city''s pools. The Pedestrian bridge will take you to the river beach and pool area on the left bank of the river that the locals wittingly named Copacabana. In the summer, this is the most visited place in the city and although it is quite smaller than the one in Rio, Copacabana offers fantastic weather and enough space for sunbathing and recreation. 10. The red „Fićo"" monument An art installation that you should not miss tells the story of David and Goliath. The little red car was demolished by a large tank during the Croatian War of Independence and symbolically represents the beginning of the war in the city, as well as in the whole country. But, being witty as they are, Osijek citizens did not miss a chance to pay homage to the red car by giving him the role of the winner. Today, the little red car is shown running over the big tank and this reminds the locals of their brave spirit and the successful defense the city.

155,Osijek,Day one - Getting to know the city,"If it is your first time in Osijek, you should pay a visit to Tvrđa, a fortified part of the city from the 18th century, where you will find the most notable examples of baroque architecture in country.

156,Otočac,Fish farm Gacka,"The tradition of producing fish has been around at this fish farm for three decades in continuity. There is also a plant for fish processing and the production of a wide range of prepared and processed fish products. From our range, we can highlight the rainbow trout, indigenous and salmon-like brown trout for consumption, fillets of the previously mentioned trout, cold-smoked fillet of the Gacka trout and caviar and pate as delicacies, also made from the Gacka trout."
156,Otočac,Croatian Centre for Indigenous Karst Water Fish and Crawfish Species,"The Croatian Centre for Indigenous Karst Water Fish and Crawfish Species was set up in Otočac in 2006. The founders are the Town of Otočac, the Croatian Chamber of Economy, the Ruđer Bošković Institute and the company Gacka d.o.o. The Centre operates as an independent association of legal entities. Activities: • Scientific research of indigenous karst water fish and crawfish species, with emphasis on their genetic profile and spawning • breeding fry for karst water restocking • development of projects and programmes for commercial breeding of indigenous karst water fish and crawfish species • branding Pećina (Cave) in Ličko Lešće In a historical and cultural sense, the region of Gacka is most famous for the Iapodic culture. It was a grand, impressive, rich culture which lasted over a thousand years in continuity. It is considered that it spanned the period from 11th century BC and that it continued to function during the Roman rule, in parallel with the culture of the Roman conquerors, until a century or so AD. Even though the Iapodic culture, which is increasingly being divided from the Illyrian culture by modern science, and which considers the Iapods as a separate entity and ethnicity, belongs to prehistory, something must have existed earlier. Because it is not expected that such a culture originates by itself, out of thin air. That period before, which is also prehistoric because there are no written clues, preceded the Bronze Age and was part of the Neolithic period of the Stone Age. Between the earlier and later Stone Age there was a transitional period, the so-called Mesolithic. In the area of the Gacka region today, the Mesolithic spanned the period from around 10.000 BC to 6.500 BC. It was a time when man was still a wild animal hunter. But what is the evidence that this is correct in the Gacka region? Pećina. This is not a generic name for every cavernous area, but rather the name of the cave near the spring Pećina in Lešće, therefore, near the source of Kostelka, the tributary of the river Gacka. Besides, that part of Lešće bears the same name. The LešćePećina (Cave) is truly impressive, the aperture is large, and its floor gently slopes into the depths. Certain archaeological excavations have documented traces of carbonised wild animal bones (hunter) from the Mesolithic period and the bones have visible traces of tools, but allegedly, traces of the culture from the later, Iapodic period have also been found. That is Pećina's testimony of its use in a very large time period, some of it in continuity, some of it with interruptions. For visitors, this archaeological site is basically in the palm of their hands. One only needs to gently ascend some hundred meters from the spring Pećina, i.e., the Croatian Centre for Indigenous Species of Fish and Crayfish in Karstic Waters and descend to the other side to the cave, use his/her imagination and try and return a few thousand years in the past to feel the scents of the past. There is a rock shelter here, the forest is right there, the water and the entire prehistoric comfort. Hence, Pećina (Cave) is a first-rate tourist site."
156,Otočac,The Shrine of the god Mithras,"Not far from the airport at Špilnik, around 2 kilometres from the road towards Gospić, there is a shrine from 2nd and 3rd century AD where the followers of the god Mithras made offerings and performed cult pagan ceremonies. The Gacka region is the second Croatian destination according to the number of Mithras' shrines, right after Salona near Split. Besides this shrine, a second one can be found in Rajanovgrič in Čović, a third one on the slope of Godača in Sinac, while one relief plaque ended up in the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, at one time having been found in the stone fence of the vicarage in Sinac. Apart from the abovementioned, several more stone inscriptions have been found mentioning the pagan god Mithras because, according to the belief, Mithras was born from stone. - In the Late antiquity, Mithraism was also popular in the Gacka region, brought by Roman slaves, traders, and craftsmen. The Mithras shrine in Kraljevstolac was carved into stone, while the relief depicts the most important event of the Mithras cult - tauroctony, i.e., the moment when Mithras slays a bull. Mithras is depicted as a young man in a Phrygian garment, kneeling on the bull, holding it by its nostrils, while slaying it with the other hand. Rituals were performed in front of the Mithras' shrine, but not much is known about them today because they were a tightly guarded secret. This religion was reserved only for men and the cult members were connected as brothers. The followers of the cult went through seven degrees of initiation and they ate bread with wine to commemorate the Mithras and Sol Invictus banquet after sacrificing the bull."
156,Otočac,Gacka Park of Croatian Memory,"For arrangement of the church surroundings the Designers anticipated placement of stone cubes in order to decompound the space. On the cubes they shaped important persons, events or cultural facts from Gacka and Otočac region. Chakavian Parliament of Gacka region suggested giving sculptor content to those stone blocks by making each block one of the glagolitic letters. Following that thought, 30 sculptures were created, which tells a story in stone, from the beginning of the 9th century, ending with the 21st century. A well know sculptor from Pula, Šime Vidulin, who was given complete freedom when choosing the artists, set a goal to make the colonies international, and to bring new (other) artists every year. Fortress Fortica in Otočac Fortica, a fortress in Otočac, is a true rarity because it is one of the only two remaining regular triangular forts in Croatia, while there are only several of them in Europe. Fifteen Stations of the Way of the Cross, placed on Fortica's slope, are a contribution not only to the religious content in this town but also represent a distinctive artistic experience for every visitor. The sculptural Calvary of Otočac begins at the foot of Fortica with the Most Holy Trinity piece. It continues with fifteen stone steles which are placed from the foot of Fortica to the Chapel of Our Lady of Sorrows, located almost at the top of the hill, enriching the existing view of the area and returning an already somewhat forgotten memory of the Calvary, the other name of the hill used by the Christian faithful. The fortress Fortica was built by people of Senj with the local population in 1619, fortifying the town of Otočac on the eponymous hill, located on an island in the middle of the river Gacka, but also Senj which was defending itself in the Gacka region from Ottoman incursions. It was a fortress with three towers, the biggest on the east side and two smaller ones on the west side, interconnected by walls with a thickness of 1.80 - 2 m. It was built in haste with smaller stones, evidently, there was no time or money to carve stone blocks. The inside courtyard was very narrow and included tanks which were used to collect water. Fortica was used as a permanent residence for soldiers, storage for ammunition and gunpowder and as a storage for food with kitchens and dormitories. Archaeological research discovered the walls of each of these towers and interconnecting walls, but it also discovered the entrance door threshold. Fortica's entrance was on the south side, towards Otočac. The entrance door was high above the ground, so in the time of its construction, Fortica could only be entered by using a ladder, while later, a porch with stairs was built. During its military use, the Fortica hill was stark for defence purposes, with no trees. Fortica's first commander was Andrija Kolaković. Fortica was abandoned in the second half of the 19th century when Otočac started to systematically develop as an urban environment. All important military buildings of the Otočac regiment were located beneath Fortica. The fortress began to lose its significance at the start of the 19th century, as can be seen from the fact that it was adapted into a gunpowder magazine in 1804. In 1882, a strong wind raised the roof of the widest tower and dropped it on the ground, so not only did neglect but also the weather contributed to Fortica's deterioration. At the start of the 20 century, Fortica was being afforested. Pharmacist Častek ordered Czech pine trees to be planted on the hill's private property. The new forest was growing nicely until World War II. In 1941, the Italians that came to Otočac ordered the trees to be cut and placed their battery there. An interesting fact to mention is that the fortress Fortica, in its restored and preserved state, is now the only renaissance remnant in the Otočac area. In fact, before the Renaissance, rectangular forts were built and the triangular ones were much rarer, while in the Renaissance, the forts and castles were fortified with round towers."
156,Otočac,Velebit Bear Orphanage,"The village of Kuterevo is situated at the north-east slope of the Mount Velebit along the border of the Velebit Nature Park. Apart from forestry, the people of Kuterevo are still engaged in the old craft of woodworking. Kuterevo lies in the proximity of the Senj - Otočac - Plitvice road, with the Otočac - Krasno - Sv. Juraj road running along the west fringes of the Kuterevo valley. Owing to its geographic location in North Velebit in the vicinity of an area densely populated by bear habitats, Kuterevo has become home to the first Bear Orphanage in Croatia, providing shelter to young, abandoned bears. The bear orphanage project (popularly known as: The Velebit Bear) has been initiated by the Croatian Centre ""Knowledge for Environment"" and is implemented on site by the Velebit association Kuterevo - VUK. The project is aimed to build and establish the first bear orphanage in Croatia in order to help efficiently protect the brown bear species and to contribute, through education of the local population and visitors, to a better awareness of the valuable biodiversity in the Velebit Nature Park area and the need for its preservation. The Kuterevo Orphanage is run by a team of nature lovers composed of biology and environmental protection experts and layman volunteers who are motivated by their great love of bears. They all selflessly care for the bear inhabitants of Kuterevo and are anxious to provide the young animals with a safer future and the living conditions as similar as possible to their original habitat. The Velebit Bear Orphanage in Kuterevo will serve as part of the visitor centre as well as being an attractive site for the promotion of the Velebit Nature Park. The first inhabitants of the Orphanage: the bear couple Mrnjo Brundo and Janja Zora. To visit the Orphanage, please make an appointment at: Fax: +385 53 799 600 Phone. +385 53 799 222 Mobile: + 385 91 583 54 12 E-mail: kuk-kuterevo@gs.t-com.hr"
156,Otočac,Angling on the Gacka River,"The Gacka Beauty, 61 km long with its tributaries, springs unexpectedly quiet from below Godača and Venac hills in Sinac. Once out of the karst underground, it shows its liveliness and playfulness after fifty meters already. It rushes down in small cascades, forming a river stream or tributaries. It lazily meanders down the plain to Karlov kanal near Otočac. From this point on it merges with the Lika River. Although essentially a karst river, the Gacka is extremely slow and quiet with a uniform flow of water. Apart form the uniform abundance of its source, the Gacka is known for its stability and small temperature differences. The average annual water temperature is 9.4°C (7.9°C in winter, 10.8°C in summer), which is particularly suitable to the fish of the salmonid family. The Gacka water is rich in oxygen (9.1 to 13.5 mg/l), even to supersaturated conditions. It is slightly alkaline as well as fairly hard and rich in calcium salts. The flora and fauna of the Gacka River is very rich. The aquatic vegetations of mosses, algae and woody plants are lush due to favorable water temperature, good chemical composition and muddy bottom. From the fish species, the Gacka is renowned for its brown trout (Salmo trutta), truly a mecca for passionate anglers. Because of the abundance of food, the Gacka brown trout grows 5-7 times faster than in any other trout water in the world. Capital specimens of the Gacka''s trout have been known to grow up to 5 kg. The angling season on the Gacka River opens 1 March and closes 31 October. The Gacka River means life for the people of the Gacko polje. In addition to using its waters for drinking (the Gacka River is the second highest for quality of potable water in Europe), they catch its fish and cut its water plants for their cattle. At the sources (in Sinac and Lešće), they have built many watermills to grind grain, wooden hammers to pound and soften homespun cloth and baskets and to roll the rough blankets made of homespun cloth. The watermills on the Gacka River in Sinac are particularly attractive as an authentic reminder of the traditional construction on water and the old crafts. The wooden hammer for cloth pounding preserved in Sinac is one of the rare such apparatuses in Croatia still in operation. Come and see the watermills in Sinac, smell the freshly ground flour, hear the clattering of the mill stone and the roaring of the clear water crashing onto the drive wheel, or just enjoy the fresh air."
156,Otočac,Angling regime,"The main stream of the Gacka River is divided into A, B and C angling zones. The A Zone encompasses the Gacka stream from the source at Tonković vrilo to the Stanišić (Rogić) Bridge, including the Sinačka pučina from the pond dam to the confluence into the River Gacka. Only fly angling is allowed. This zone is a catch-and-release-area, particularly in the area of the Podgora Bridge (the first bridge) upstream from the confluence of the Sinačka pučina into the Gacka. The area from the Knjapovac Brook to Tonković vrilo is a natural reserve where angling is prohibited. The B Zone encompasses the Gacka stream from the Stanišić Bridge to the confluence of the Gacka in the Poljica Tunnel. Fly angling and any type of artificial fly is allowed. Zone C encompasses Švica Lake and Gusić Polje Lake. Artificial lures are allowed. Weights and floats are not allowed with artificial flies."
156,Otočac,Museum of Gacka,"Gacka Museum in Otočac is a county museum with a rich historical and cultural tradition. The museum is located in the very center of the city. In the collection entitled ''Otočac through History'' one can trace the events in the area of Gacka from distant prehistory, Romans, first mention of the town, wars against the Turks, Military Frontier, World Wars I and II to the period of the economic and cultural development of the city and the suffering in the Homeland War of 1991. The Archaeological ''Iapydic'' Collection is presented in the objects of material culture: jewelry, weapons, tools, kitchenware, life and work of the Illyrian tribe of Iapydes from middle to late Bronze Age, i.e., from the 10th century BC to the arrival of the Romans at the end of the 1st century BC. The ethnographic collection reflects the traditional life and culture of Gacka in the last hundred years, presenting exhibits from the traditional culture characteristic of the area, such as tools for manufacture of textile products, pottery, and male and female national costumes. Particularly valuable is the Memorial Collection of the Academic Painter Stojan Aralica, a world-renowned colorist who was born in Otočac. The exhibits include his oil paintings, drawings in ink, pencil and charcoal, as well as his personal items, documents, photographs, painting tools, and books. The Homeland War Collection presents the light and heavy weaponry used in the war, as well as the remains of shells, air-dropped bombs, different caliber bullets, etc. The collection also presents the chronology of war developments with pictures of damaged facilities and buildings. Otočac - the oldest settlement in the Gacka valley Otočac is the seat of the Gacka area and the seat of township. It is one of the oldest towns with Croatian population. The first written records of the town date back to the end of the 11th century (1100) and the Baška Tablet, an inscribed stone tablet from the island of Krk which belongs among the earliest known monuments to Croatian literacy and culture. At that time, St. Nicholas Monastery in Otočac was affiliated with St. Lucy's Convent in Baška on the island of Krk. However, historians believe that Otočac dates farther back than the 11th century and assume that Duke Borna probably had one of his seats in Otočac at the beginning of the 9th century. Otočac owes its name and its survival to a river island. Up until the 18th century Otočac was situated on a small natural island in the Gacka river. The island was surrounded with fortification walls and towers for protection and could be accessed only by boat. This made it invincible and throughout its long history Otočac was never a conquered town. Traces of early human habitation have been found locally. The hill forts in Umac and Vinica, and the nearby Zorišnjak near Staro Selo, testify to the settlements dating back to the Iapodic time. These hill forts are yet to be subject to detailed archaeological study. Events in Otočac 1. Eco-ethno Gacka Otočac The Tourist Board of the City of Otočac organises the Eco-ethnicGacka event since 2003. The organisation started 13 years ago in order to enrich the tourist offer of the City of Otočac, but also to help the manufacturers who do not have the necessary resources to enter a larger market. Every year, the fair has more and more exhibitors, but also visitors who have been attracted by a diverse offer of both old and new authentic products and an interesting and rich cultural and artistic programme. Active following and cheering for front-runners in cooking contests for lovačkikotlić (goulash with game and mushrooms)has become a traditional and indispensable part of the Fair, characterised as a friendly battle between professionals and amateurs for the title of the best lovačkikotlićcook of the City of Otočac. Eco-ethnic fair is an opportunity for the presentation and sale of the products of registered exhibitors, but also to present the Gacka Valley as a tourist destination which has something to offer to tourists even during the summer months, along with socialising and competition in a friendly setting. 2. Otočac Folklore Festival The Folklore Festival is a traditional event which has been held in Otočac since 1999. Gacka Public Open University is the organiser of this two-day event which includes the selection of the finest male and female costumes, the parade of folklore groups through the city streets and individual performances of groups and a final concert. The Festival is usually held in the middle of June, in the open in the city centre itself. To this day, this Festival has grown into a main event of the traditional culture of the Lika-Senj County and the only one of its kind on the territory of the County. The Festival gathers almost all folklore groups from the territory of the Lika-Senj County, but also guest groups from different regions of Croatia. Each year, the Festival attracts several thousands of participants and visitors, all united in the intent to present and preserve the non-material cultural heritage of the Dinaric folklore region: dances, songs and other customs which have almost been forgotten."
157,Pag,Pag,"At a first sight, Pag looks rocky and rough, bordered by a sky-blue sea, almost nestled under Mount Velebit's imposing presence. It's often referred to as the ""Island of Stone"" or a ""Moonscape Island"" due to its an eerie surface with its rocky terrain and as many different shapes as only nature can create on such a huge insular expanse. The island of Pag is one of the sunniest Adriatic islands, with over 2,500 hours of sunshine per year. Among the Adriatic's over 1,000 islands, Pag stands out, for its stony exterior conceals the wealth created over the centuries by the sturdy hands of its hard-working denizens.

157,Pag,Prosika Town Beach,"The Prosika Town Beach is the central beach, particularly suited for swimming and sun-bathing by families with small children. The beach features the requisite tourist amenities (beach volleyball, tennis, pedal-boats, water-scooters and jet-skies) and hospitality establishments. Bašaca Beach Beaches can also be found in the Bašaca and Vodice areas. Bašaca actually has a complex of smaller beaches which, thanks to their appearance and ambience, are suited to tourists who want to sun-bathe and enjoy the sea. Access is exceptionally simple thanks to a road that passes right next to the shore. Zrće Beach Zrće Beach is situated on the western side of the Pag Bay. It is adored by those who want all-day entertainment. There are several establishments on the beach that operate as cafes during the day then become bars and dance clubs at night.

Bošana Beach The beaches at Bošana, about a 15 minute drive from the town of Pag, have cooler water because of freshwater springs. A pine grove was planted in Bošana recently, while the oak forests at Sveta Marija and Dubrava have been placed under protection."
157,Pag,Vodice Beach,The Vodice area abounds in diverse beaches: from clean rocky shores to pebble beaches. The pebble beaches in this area are more difficult to access as they are in smaller coves.

Visitors can see how Pag lace is made and relax among products of various lacemaking techniques that are true artworks produced by the skilful hands of Pag lace-makers. The rich display exhibits lace from various periods: replicas of Pag lace made after old Budak's patterns, various textile items used in Pag households, pieces of garments worn by Pag residents throughout history, and the latest creations. The stone edifice of the Rector's Palace forms the backdrop against which old photographs of Pag lace-makers are on display with the lace, giving visitors a moment to appreciate the transience of our earthly existence, and of the eternity of cultural values that make the town of Pag so special. Bartul Kašić permanent display During Venetian rule, Pag's citizens were exempt from participation in military campaigns due to the importance of salt production. However, Ivan Petar Kašić waived the exemption and participated in one of the most important battles in history: the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. He married Ivanica Bogdaničić in 1574, and their son Bartul, Pag's greatest son, was born on the day of the Assumption of Mary in 1575."
157,Pag,Exhibition of sacred art,"An exhibition of Pag lace and a permanent exhibition of ecclesiastical art were opened in the Benedictine monastery of St. Margarita. The exhibitions are set up in a building in Koludraška Street in Pag, which is part of the monastery complex. Exhibitions can be viewed every day from 6 pm to 9 pm. Valuable art objects, works of art, painting and sculpture are preserved in the monastery, some of which go beyond the local limits of Pag, and with their quality and excellence, they are among the most valuable works of art that would elevate even larger environments. The exhibition was designed by the architect Željko Kovačić, and numerous valuable reliquaries, paintings and statues were placed at the exhibition, among which the Reliquary of the Crown of Thorns from the 15th century, the sculpture of St. Margaritas from the 14th century and a painting of the Virgin and Child from the 15th century. Benedictine Monastery of St. Margarite in Pag recently received an award for the permanent exhibition of church art and the efforts of nuns in preserving the art for future generations."
157,Pag,Morning in the salt fields,"Solana Pag from 01.06. offers open-air educational workshops for all those interested. At the workshops, you can learn about the history of the Saltworks, how salt is produced, then and now, and about the composition, quality and importance of salt.

One workshop would be with a story, a walk to the pool, a demonstration of salt (small, large and salt flower), where they can try and feel the difference, and the other, in addition to all that, offers salt collection with the assistance of an experienced employee of the Pag Saltworks."
157,Pag,Permanent Exhibition of Salt Production,"We simply do not know precisely how long salt has been produced in Pag. Salt production in the Croatian lands was first mentioned in the book about Adriatic salt pans by Prof. Candide from the university in Naples, published in 1912. He stressed that already in the 3rd century BC, the Illyrians (he meant the Liburnians) had travelled from the Croatian lands to the Apennine peninsula and taught the local inhabitants how to produce sea salt and in the process they established what is now the Italian salt plant, Regina Margarita. The first written data on actual salt production in Pag originated in a will from the year 999. Data on salt pans in Pag can be followed through the following years, often in wills and other documents. This was a time when salt was valued as white gold. Družina Ethno-Gallery The Ethno-Gallery of the Družina Culture and Arts Association contains many valuable exhibits: typical Pag blouses adorned with Pag lace, older women's and men's folk attire, various items of apparel, antique parts of furniture and photographs that testify to life as it once was in Pag. The Družina Association was established in 1949 with the objective of preserving, preparing and publicly presenting authentic folklore in the areas of dancing, vocal and instrumental music and other, similar folkloric and ethnographic expression, as well as continuous study of folkloric creativity with the aim of preserving its authenticity. The members of Družina are genuine guardians of the rich cultural heritage which they proudly and lovingly nurture, preserve and hand down from generation to generation."
157,Pag,Pag Salt,"Salt, along with lace, is the white gold of the town of Pag. The island's salt pans are among the oldest in the eastern Adriatic seaboard, first mentioned in 10th-century chronicles. The traditional technique of natural evaporation was abandoned with the construction of a salt factory. Today the facility, Solana Pag, with its pans and clay pools for evaporation, cover about 2 million square meters and, together with 9 depots and a plant floor, make it the largest production plant in Croatia. Baškotini - ""Croatian Creation"" For centuries, the Benedictine Convent of St. Margaret in Pag has produced the baškotin - certainly the oldest local treat: a type of hard sweet toasted biscuit made according to a special convent recipe. The Benedictine nuns have nurtured the tradition of making the baškotin for over 300 years. Pag residents are very fond of it; in times past, they greeted guests with baškotini and white coffee, and any family celebration was considered unthinkable without them. Today the Pag's baškotin carries the label ""Croatian Creation"" and ""Croatian Island Product."""
157,Pag,Pag Lamb,"The meat of Pag lambs has a specific flavour because of the environment in which these indigenous sheep live and in which they feed. This is karst, a harsh rocky terrain in which various medicinal herbs grow; specifically, sage, a tiny sparse herb covered in a coating of sea-salt blown in by winter winds. Thanks to this type of diet and growth, the meat of the Pag lambs has a unique flavour, and the world's connoisseurs of fine food consider it among the finest specialities. Žutica Wine For centuries, the production of grapes and wine has been an important industry and a vital aspect of development on the island of Pag. White wine made from several grape varieties has been produced on the island since ancient times, and was named ""The Žutica of Pag"" because of its deep yellow colour. The main variety for wine production has been Gegić, the island's leading variety."
157,Pag,Delicacy - Pag Cheese,"Besides lamb, cheese is the best known culinary brand from the island of Pag. It is made exclusively from the milk of the indigenous sheep of Pag. When the winds blowing off the Velebit massif sprinkle sea salt over the local vegetation, the Pag sheep, feeding on these salted plants and medicinal herbs, produce milk with a very unique flavour and aroma. Aged Pag cheese that is over five months old has a typically sharp flavour, an intense aroma and slightly granular structure which crumbles pleasantly and melts in the mouth. Today Pag cheese may be purchased at family farms that produce cheese, or at one of the cheese factories on the island, which have merged tradition with technology. This product carries the label ""Croatian Creation"" and represents Pag and Croatia at all trade fairs in the European Union."
157,Pag,Summer and Winter Carnivals,"The Pag carnival has a long tradition. The Winter Carnival is organized for the local population, and it begins on the first Saturday after the Epiphany and it lasts until Ash Wednesday. During this period, dances (tanci) are organized every Saturday. On the final three days, the carnival festivities move to the central town square. The Summer Carnival is held on the last weekend in July with the aim of enriching the entertainment on offer during the tourist season."
157,Pag,Lace,"Pag lace is a unique product of the hard-working and skilful hands of the women from the town of Pag. Lace-making is a very old tradition throughout the Mediterranean. In the town of Pag, the making of lace for the needs of women's and clerical vestments was already recorded in the mid-15th century. In the Convent of St. Margaret, the nuns instructed girls, teaching them to read and write and to make lace. Archival sources from 1579 testify to this. History recalls the time when Pag's women were summoned to Vienna to the imperial court before the Archduchess Maria Josepha, the emperor's mother, to show her how Pag lace is made. Word of the beauty and perfection of this lace was carried far and wide, and its production intensified after the establishment of the Lacemaking School in Pag in 1906. The school operated until 1945."
157,Pag,Folk Attire,"Pag's folk attire is especially beautiful and known throughout Europe. When speaking of Pag folk attire, one first thinks of the old-style women's clothing, particularly the lace made by needlepoint, the blouses and headgear (called pokrivaca). The Pag blouse and pokrivaca are sewn on a base (with threads). This work by Pag's women is called the Pag teg. An integral component of the folk costume is the jewellery, specially made earrings (ročini) and necklaces made of strings of beads and pins for the pokrivaca. The parts of the women's attire adorned with initial lace, reticella, made on threads and a base, the Pag teg, and lace separated from its base, which Pag's women called the Italian teg, have been registered in the list of protected culture goods of the Republic of Croatia and bear the label ""Croatian Creation,"" and they are under UNESCO protection as well."
157,Pag,Pag-style Circle Dance,"The Pag circle dance is performed to the accompaniment of brass music. It is performed on the final days of the carnival, on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, in the central town square. Particular credit for maintaining this tradition goes to Maestro Šime Dešpalj, who, as the music director in Pag, arranged and set to music the choreography of the circle-dance, which is even today performed in line with the beats of his music. Dešpalj also deserves thanks for the fact that Pag has its ""Waltz on the Pag Waterfront. ""Slave Girl of Pag"" ""Slave Girl"" is a folk play which is traditionally performed during the carnival period and as part of the Pag Summer and Ethno-Evenings. In times past, a troupe wearing Pag folk attire and ""Turkish"" uniforms toured the town and displayed their craft in the squares or in front of the houses of notable townsfolk. Today, ""Slave Girl"" is performed by three groups of members belonging to the Družina Culture and Arts Association."
157,Pag,The Tanac Folk Dance of Pag,"The Pag tanac (dance) is performed to the accompaniment of bagpipes. This is a depiction of an encounter between young women and men wearing folk attire who, by dancing, clapping their hands and twirling, attract each other's attention in order to dance together. Today the Pag tanac is performed only by members of the Družina Culture and Arts Association during the carnival, during the summer months as part of the ""Outing with the Association"" and the ""Ethno-outing About Town."" There is also the Veli tanac (‘big dance') in which about 40 couples of all ages perform at the same time."
157,Pag,Stacked Stone Walls,"Stacked stone walls and boundaries are a vital aspect of Pag's past and eternal monuments to the arduous life of Pag's labourers, who built and maintained them for centuries. Based on the length of the preserved stacked stone walls of approximately one thousand kilometres, the island of Pag is one of the richest areas in Croatia for this type of construction. They were erected as natural boundaries between pastures, high enough so that sheep could not jump over them and sturdy enough so that they could not be toppled by strong winds. Their construction was not easy. Activities aimed at the protection of stacked stone structures on Pag were initiated due to the exceptional importance of stacked stone walls, and to prevent their destruction."
157,Pag,Velo Blato Ornithological Reserve,"The Velo Blato Ornithological Reserve is located on the southern side of the island of Pag. This area has great biological value, because it is a habitat for over 160 species of marsh birds, of which 66 species nest here. Migratory birds stopover in this little corner to rest and feed. Velo Blato is ideal for photographers who want to photograph various bird species close up. An observation tower, installed at the very edge of Velo Blato, can be used to observe and photograph birds and the rest of the wetland environment."
157,Pag,Lokunja - Medicinal Mud,"A natural spa rich in mud sediments is situated in the Lokunja section, in the very heart of the town of Pag. This mud effectively treats rheumatism and various skin conditions. This therapy has been proven to help maintain moisture in the skin and body, restore natural pH balance to the skin, relieve pores and facilitate circulation, and prevent and treat acne. It reduces inflammation, detoxifies and tones the skin, relieves pain and fosters relaxation, successfully removing toxins that have accumulated in the body."
157,Pag,Sacred heritage,"Church of St. Francis The Church of St. Francis (‘Sveti Frane' in Croatian) was built in the latter half of the 15th century in the northern part of the old town core. Works on its façade continued until mid-1510s. A monastery next to it belonging to the order of Friars Minor Conventual was dissolved in 1785. There is no significant artwork inside the church, but the tombstones of Pag's noble families with their heraldic emblems and inscriptions have been preserved, including the plaque of Elizabeta, the daughter of a Pag potentate, Jerolim Bragadin. Concerts are held in the Church during the Pag Cultural Summer, organized by Nina and Lovro Pogorelić, which is the most important and the most attractive part of the Pag Summer."
157,Pag,Co-cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary is situated on the main town square and is the most valuable monument of ecclesiastical architecture in Pag. The cornerstone was laid on 18 May 1443, marking the commencement of its long-lasting construction. It was constructed by master-builders from Šibenik and Zadar. The sources confirm the names of Juraj Dalmatinac and Zadar architects Pavao Juraj Dimitrov, Marko Andrijić and Nikola Alegreti. The portal's lunette has great artistic value and was probably made by Ivan Pribislavić or Petar Berčić. In canonical terms, the church is collegiate, and to this day it has a college of canons headed by the chapter archpriest with the title mitred abbot of St. Peter, held over from the ancient Monastery of St. Peter the Apostle at Prosika. The façade of the church repeats the Romanesque-Gothic contours of the college seat in the Old Town. A rich stone rosette, relief images of Sts. George and Michael and a composition of the Annunciation of Mary are notable on the actual façade. The Madonna is portrayed in the portal's lunette, protecting the pious natives of Pag with her mantle. The church has five marble altars installed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Particularly notable is the large altar pall showing the Madonna, St. Dominic with St. Catherine of Sienna and the known participants in the Battle of Lepanto. This picture has high artistic value, and according to the records from the Archives of St. Dominic in Zadar, it has been attributed to the renowned Venetian painter Tintoretto. The Holy Cross, a wooden Gothic crucifix, is revered there; according to a document from 1413 held in Pag's Register of Charters, blood once flowed from it. The crucifix from the former Church of the Holy Cross in the Old Town was brought to the Dominican church in Pag's new town, while in the 19th century is was moved to the collegiate seat in Pag."
157,Pag,Benedictine monastery,"The construction of the monastery of the Benedictine nuns of Pag began immediately after the foundation of the new Pag and was dedicated to St. Margarita the Virgin and the Martyr in memory of the former church and monastery in Stari Grad. The Church of the Annunciation of Mary was built next to the monastery, and was completed in 1483. Chapel of St. Nikola, later Our Lady of Mercy, the distinguished noble family of Pag, Mišolić, entrusts the creation to master Juraj Dalmatinac, and he later to his student Radmil Alegreti. After the restoration of the church, the chapel was completely restored and restored to its original state, and therefore represents the most valuable architectural monument of the Gothic-Renaissance style in Pag. Monastery of nuns of St. Benedikta was known as a noble monastery because the nuns were mostly members of the noble class. Along with prayer, the nuns taught female children in lacemaking and literacy since the 16th century, and later they opened a women's primary school with expert teachers where they taught lacemaking in particular. In 1875, Emperor Franjo Josip visited the monastery and school of the Benedictine nuns of Pag, and in the beginning of the 20th century, the empress mother Marija Jozefa honored the Benedictine nuns with her visit. During World War II, the monastery and its soup kitchen were helped by Croatian Caritas and Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac, feeding children and the poor. During the Homeland War, the nuns were associated with Caritas from Italy and France and with numerous friends of the monastery in the world and thus helped the suffering population, refugees and exiles. The nuns guard the mighty St. The thorn in which is the relic of the Thorn of the Crown of Christ brought from the Holy Land by Friar Tutnić in 1433, as evidenced by a public document in the Pag Diplomatarium. This most beautiful Pag reliquary was made in one of Zadar's goldsmith's workshops. The Benedictine order is a very strict cloister and the nuns do not leave the monastery except in special cases with the permission of the superior. In 2008, the Benedictine nuns of Pag received an award from Zadar County for the development of the spiritual culture of the city of Pag, and the widely known prior M. Rozari Gligor received a lifetime achievement award for merits in the field of culture."
157,Pag,Salt storage,"The salt warehouses are structures in the monument category, situated opposite the town core at Prosika. They testify to utilitarian architecture of past times and the importance of salt production to Pag's natives. The first three warehouses were built in the 17th century, while the other six were constructed during the second Austrian administration."
157,Pag,Town Walls,"Until the mid-19th century, the town of Pag was encircled by sizeable and lovely walls with defence towers. Pag had several town gates, and the largest was in the Katine section, called the Porta Marina. Only the lintel of Rector Nikola Tiepolo remains preserved from this gate. The Minor Gate was a little farther south. Skrivanat Tower was erected, as recorded by the inscription bearing the crest of Rector Toma Zorzi, in 1468, and together with part of the town wall it is the best preserved part of Pag's defensive system. Today a promenade passes next to the tower, and in the summer months it is a venue for various cultural events and entertainment, such as performances by a capella ensembles and choirs, plays and summer workshops. Today's town hall was constructed in 1906 on the former Kamerlengo Tower. Well-known Pag Mayor Frane Budak had it built at the site for the needs of the Pag Municipality of the time. Part of the southern town wall is visible in the town's south, in the southern end of the Katine section. Meridian 15 East The town of Pag already had one of the first sundials in Europe at the end of the 19th century. The marker for meridian 15 is roughly 5 km from Pag, on a macadam road, in a tract named after St. Mary Magdalene, with a marble marker set along the intersecting line. Rector's Palace The Rector's Palace is located on the main square. It was built in the 15th century and completed under the rule of Rector Toma Zorzi. It has been the centre of town and island administration for centuries. From Venetian times until the early 19th century, the palace was the seat of the rector, and later on the town rector and magistrate. A well in the palace courtyard has an ornamented crown and the coats of arms of Pag's dukes. Master-builders of the Dalmatinac circles from Šibenik and Zadar participated in the construction of the Rector's Palace. The entrance (atrium), which according to its inscription was built in 1467, is adorned by one of the most beautiful portals on Pag. The stylistic features show that it was made under the influence of master Juraj Dalmatinac (Giorgio de Sebenico) and also displays traces of work by Ivan Pribislavić. The Rector's Palace is today a renovated cultural monument that serves as a venue for plays and concerts as part of the Pag Cultural Summer festival."
157,Pag,Skrivanat Tower,"Skrivanat Tower is the only remaining tower out of the 9 towers that defended the town of Pag. It was built in the 15th century and has been preserved in its original shape. A promenade takes you by the tower, which hosts cultural events and entertainment during the summer months, including klapa (a capella) and choir performances, plays, summer workshops, and the like."

It provides a view of most of the island's settlements: Pag, Kolan, Šimuni, Mandre and Košljun; and of the neighbouring islands of Rab, Lošinj, Silba, Olib and Maun. Several marked hiking paths lead from Dubrava and Kolan to Sveti Vid Peak. A newly made path leading from the old heart of Šimuni to the peak can be approached by car."
157,Pag,The Old Town of Pag,"Pag's Old Town is located a kilometre south of today's town core. What used to be a large and rich town is today is an archaeological site and shrine. The Romanesque Church of St. Mary with a statue of the Mother of God has been preserved along with the remains of a Franciscan monastery. Pag's residents maintain the tradition of pilgrimages from the Old Town to ""new"" Pag on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary into Heaven, carrying a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The votive procession first began in 1885. A cholera epidemic hit Pag in 1852 and raged in intervals and, to prevent contagion, all graves were relocated from the town and its churches. On the Feast of the Assumption in 1885, the people of Pag gathered spontaneously in the Old Town, around Mary's statue, praying for salvation from the cruel disease. They carried the statue to Pag's parish church. The last cholera victims were buried on 16 August of the same year, the Feast of St. Roch. It was then that the people of Pag vowed to bring Mary's statue to Pag every year and put it on display in the Church for 22 days, until the Nativity of Mary, enabling the congregation to thank her and pray for salvation, health, peace, and love."
157,Pag,Katine Bridge,A new bridge that connects the new town of Pag with Prosika replaced the early 20th century concrete bridge. The bridge is a somewhat altered replica of an old Venetian bridge built in 1737 based on the design by renowned Venetian architect Giambattista Lodoli.

159,Pakrac,Pakrac,"Pakrac is a town that is attracting an increasing number of visitors thanks to its geographical position, good traﬃc connections, nature, cultural heritage and potentials for tourism development. There is nothing to stop you from visiting Pakrac thanks to its geographical position since it has good traﬃc connections to many European and world destinations. Furthermore, there are Airport Zagreb and Airport Osijek in the close proximity of Pakrac. Pakrac features moderate continental climate which means summers are warm and dry with temperatures up to 30°C while winters are idyllic with low temperatures and snow from November to March. Pakrac is a charming small town of rich history marked by its landlords - family Janković and baron Trenk, as well as the mint where coins of Slavonski banovac were minted. It is only up to you to unveil the rich oﬀer of Pakrac history and fall in love with it. Pakrac is the cradle of the alarm clock! Konstantin Haidenegg, the director of Royal Mail Oﬃce and Telegraphs Pakrac at the time, patented the alarm clock in 1896. The fact that this alarm clock was powered by an electric battery shows how much it was ahead of its time a lot earlier and even before some far more known cities in Europe saw the light powered by electricity. Complex of the Jankovićs Estate. Jankovićs of Daruvar was a family of counts who became owners of the Pakrac feudal estate in the middle of the 18th century mostly influencing the development of Pakrac and its surroundings. The estate of Pakrac was managed by the Jankovićsfor one hundred years (1761 - 1861) and it was significantly upgraded during the time. The centre of the once feudal possession has remained the heart of the town even today under a common name of the Complex of the Jankovićs Estate. Pakrac city - cradle of coins! In the ancient times of the Middle Ages, in the year of 1256, Pakrac was the place where Croatian money, used only in the area of the Croatian Kingdom, was coined. Its name was the Slavonian Banovac. In those times, produce and goods were used in trading and it has been presumed that one of the most important methods of payment was marten fur. This is the reason why on one side of that coin there was a representation of a running marten between two stars and on the other, a double cross with two crowned heads which most surely represented the ruling system in the then Croatia. The well-known mint of Pakrac minted coins of high quality silver and tremendous workmanship, therefore, they were also used in trading in other Central European countries. It is why the modern Croatian currency was given its name - Kuna (marten) and its point of origin is right here in Pakrac. Your example of a coin, you can mint in the museum of the city of Pakrac! Pakrac is the cradle of the alarm clock! Konstantin Haidenegg, the director of Royal Mail Office and Telegraphs Pakrac at the time, patented the alarm clock in 1896.

161,Pearl of Zagorje,Cultural heritage,"The sarcophagi of the Erdödy family The monumental building of the Franciscan monastery and the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Klanjec, has been hiding a secret for many years. At the end of the last century, the tomb of the Erdödy family was discovered in the church's womb. The expensive sarcophagi from the 17th century of the Croatian Ban Sigismund Erdödy and the benefactor of the monastery of Varaždin, mayor Emerik Erdödy, were restored in 1999 and 2003 and housed in a specially prepared crypt of the monastery arranged for tourist visits, which has yet to be restored. The sarcophagi are the work of Viennese masters and are performed in the style of early Baroque times. In their mystical form, styled very differently, both sarcophagi tell the story of that time of the Erdödy family's life, and as a rarity of Croatian cultural heritage, they attract the exceptional attention of domestic and foreign visitors. The Antun Augustinčić Gallery and Studio The Antun Augustinčić Gallery is located in the upper part of the town of Klanjec. It was founded in 1970 when Antun Augustinčić, one of the most important Croatian sculptors and representatives of modern art, donated his sculpture opus created during 50 years of creation to his hometown Klanjec. His most significant works are the monumental sculptures ""Peace"" in New York, erected next to the United Nations building and the Monument to the Peasant Revolt and Matija Gupac in Gornja Stubica.

The town of Klanjec is mentioned in written documents for the first time in the mid-15th century, although it's believed that it is much older because it was meant to defend the castle of Cesargrad, whose written traces date back to the 14th century. The name of the town derives from its geographical location − at the entrance to the Zelenjak Gorge. The town is full of amenities and details, beautiful nature and architecture. Throughout history, Klanjec had the status of a marketplace as early as the 16th century, and in the 19th century, it has become the center of a sub-county and district. The Erdödy noble family, which ruled the region for more than four centuries, gave the town most of its picturesqueness and modernity! The castle Novi Dvori Cesargradski, although partially destroyed today, is one of the most significant castles in the Croatian Zagorje. The Franciscan monastery with the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the 17th century in the picturesque Antun Mihanović Square, in whose crypts two of the restored sarcophagus of the Erdödy family can be seen today, is a legacy of immense importance."

163,Petrinja,Pecki grad,"In the village of Pecki, a square defensive tower called Pecki Grad was built, first mentioned in 1563. Today, it is preserved up to the height of the second floor."
163,Petrinja,Fortress Hrastovica,"In the Middle Ages, Hrastovica was a fortified settlement with two fortresses and a Franciscan monastery outside the walls. It played a significant role in defense against the Turks. In 1584, the Turks conquered and razed it, leading to its abandonment. After peace was restored, it was repopulated by Franciscans from Bosnia with Croatian Catholic population. During French rule (1809 - 1813), the old Roman road was restored, placing Hrastovica on the route connecting France with the Ottoman Empire. Today, the skyline of Hrastovica is dominated by the Church of St. Bartholomew, and above the village lie the remnants of the medieval town, Franciscan monastery, and the Church of the Holy Spirit. Čuntić Tower The Čuntić Tower is located on a hill above the valley of the Petrinjčica River. It defended the passage along the medieval road leading from Pounje towards Hrastovica and the Kupa River. The castle was built in 1551 by the Zagreb Chapter as a watchtower constructed of circular stone. The faces of the wall are made of hewn stone, while the middle layer is filled with rubble stone and quicklime. Partially visible on the tower is a loophole, likely in the shape of an ""X"" cross-section. Access to the tower was via a drawbridge to the first floor, and by the late 16th century, it was abandoned. Only the ruined circular tower and remnants of the defensive moat and some other buildings have survived from the fortress. The Čuntić Tower holds significant architectural and historical value."
163,Petrinja,Heritage,"The pride of Petrinja lies in its long tradition of cultural creativity, nurtured over centuries and documented in numerous publications by Petrinja's guardians of history and on the canvases of visual artists. The name Petrinja likely derives from the Latin word ""petrus,"" meaning rock, stone, or cliff, possibly linked to one of the ancient Roman settlements in the stone-rich areas of the Zrinska Gora. In strategic positions of the Banovina region, the Zagreb bishops erected a series of stone towers in the mid-16th century for defense against the Turks. Remains of these former fortresses bear witness to this history."
163,Petrinja,Monumental heritage,"Ban's Stone The monument to Ban Jelačić was erected in 1846 as a token of gratitude to Josip Jelačić, who, along with his soldiers, improved the road from Gora to Župić and widened the road from Župić to Petrinja. The restored monument was repositioned in 2009 at the same location in Župić on the main road to Glina. Catholic Cemeteries of St. Trinity and St. Roch St. Roch Cemetery is situated above the Zebinac stream in the Popova forest on one of the highest elevations surrounding the town. It is considered the oldest of the three Catholic cemeteries in Petrinja. It is assumed that the first burials occurred shortly after the construction of the wooden chapel in 1696. In its place, a stone late Baroque - Neoclassical single-nave chapel of St. Roch was built in 1823. The chapel was destroyed in the Homeland War in 1992. St. Trinity Cemetery is located amidst a deciduous forest on the Zebinac hill. It is presumed that the first burials took place shortly after the construction of the wooden chapel of St. Trinity in 1710, which was later replaced by a late Baroque - Neoclassical single-nave chapel built in 1833. The chapel was destroyed in the Homeland War, and a new one has recently been erected at the same location. The specificity of these Petrinja cemeteries is the high concentration of very old tombstones, among which the oldest and most valuable plaques from the second half of the 18th and the first half of the 19th century stand out. Monument to Stjepan Radić The monument to the Croatian politician Stjepan Radić, created by the academic sculptor Mile Wod, was erected on October 25, 1936, in Radić Square."
163,Petrinja,The Legend of Cvijeta Brestovska,"This legend was created as an original narrative from the 16th century, titled ""Cvijeta Brestovska or Blood for Blood,"" written by the author Zvonimir Pužar (1875 - 1926) and published in Đakovo in 1905. Pužar is the author of over 20 historical-popular narratives, some of which, like ""Cvijeta Brestovska,"" were adapted into stage plays. According to the legend, Cvijeta Brestovska was the daughter of Pavle Brestovski, the commander of the Christian fortress Brest on the river Kupa, who in 1574, amidst a divided and fragmented Christian army, delivered a fiery patriotic speech and united them in the fight against the superior Turks. She was the first to take up the sword, and like the French heroine Joan of Arc, she led the defenders of Brest into battle alongside her beloved Juraj Reufert, who hailed from afar but was connected to his homeland Croatia by birth and heart. Everyone joined them, and in the first act of resistance, they got rid of the spy disguised as a saint who had been transmitting information from Brest to the Turkish fortress. They threw him into the river Kupa without trial, drowning him. The brave defenders of Brest, led by Cvijeta, all perished, and after their glorious deaths, Ferhat-beg conquered the remaining fortresses between the rivers Una and Kupa."
163,Petrinja,The Cursed One of Pecko Lake,"One of the most beautiful legends from this region, based on oral folklore but enriched by artistic talent, recorded by Ivan Trnski and Đuro Arnold. Set in the time of the Banate of Croatia, this legend, reminiscent of Romeo and Juliet, speaks of the power of love that nothing, whether from this world or the next, can oppose. It tells the story of an impossible love between two young people of different backgrounds - the noble daughter Katarina and the poor fisherman Ivo. Their love draws attention to the legend of the Cursed One of Pecko Lake, the ban who, due to jealous accusations and lies, loses the love of his beloved banica and is condemned to eternal solitude at the bottom of a lake formed from the banica's tears. Disinclined towards any love, the Cursed One punishes the fisherman Ivo by dragging him to the bottom of the lake and chaining him. When Katarina learns of this, she begs the Cursed One to pardon her beloved and release him, but as he does not respond, she herself throws into the lake. Katarina's act of sacrifice awakens mercy in the Cursed One, and he saves both her and her beloved Ivo. Thus, the curse on the Cursed One is lifted, and he is pardoned, and the lake soon dries up. Even today, in the place where Pecko Lake once adorned the Hrastovica forest, during the misty times, romantic silhouettes of embraced lovers can be seen."
163,Petrinja,Doroteja and Martin Frankopan,"Petrinja stands among the rare European settlements that, throughout its history, had two locations where an urban structure ceased to exist in its original location and moved to a new area. Our story takes us to Old Medieval Petrinja, located about ten kilometers south of the present-day location. It was a time of unstable kings and the strong rise of Croatian noble families. During the 14th century, Petrinja was owned by the Babonić family, and later by the Zudar family until 1447 when Šimun Zudar pledged it for 400 forints to Doroteja, the widow of Count Ivan Babonić-Blagajski. As Doroteja married Prince Martin Frankopan already in 1448, Petrinja passed into the ownership of the famous Croatian Frankopan family, where it remained for a full 30 years. Ottoman incursions became more frequent, so Doroteja and Martin decided to leave their beloved Petrinja in 1479, and since they had no children, they donated it to the Zagreb Chapter for the ""salvation of their souls."" Initially, the Chapter fortified and strengthened the old town to resist the Ottoman onslaught. Old Petrinja was increasingly devastated, earning the historical epithet ""Deserted,"" and its traces disappeared in the whirlwind of Turkish invasions and conquests. After the decision of the Croatian Parliament in 1543, it was completely destroyed, and all material traces of it were lost."
163,Petrinja,Nova Petrinja,"Just as stories and legends, historical sources and documents are our fight against oblivion, defiance against fate, an attempt to gather scattered historical fragments for the purpose of credible material for new generations. After the old Petrinja was destroyed in 1543 by the decision of the Croatian Parliament, and all traces of it were lost, the Zagreb Chapter, for safer defense against the Turks, during 1544, with the approval of King Ferdinand, built a new and stronger fortress - Sisak. However, the Turks responded by building their own fortress at the confluence of the river Petrinja and the Kupa. Yeni Hisar or New Town, more precisely Nova Petrinja, was built in just three weeks - from April 12 to May 3, 1592. Hasan-pasha Predojević entrusted the construction to Rustem bey-pasha, one of the prominent Turkish warriors in the area of Croatian Frontier, who, with the help of thousands of builders, created a new Turkish military fortress housing a thousand Ottoman soldiers. The center of Nova Petrinja was located at the site of today's Croatian House in Petrinja. Although he tried to prevent Turkish intentions by fortifying himself in the area of Mala Gorica near Brest, Croatian Ban Toma Erdody failed to organize and unite his army gathered from various sides, so the Turks had the greatest support and threat in their new military fortress, menacing the entire Sisak Pokuplje, Turopolje, and part of Posavina."
163,Petrinja,Sacred buildings,"Parish Church of St. Lovre Strategically positioned as the dominant structure on the main square of the military center, the church was built in 1780 under the patronage of the Austrian imperial house and Maria Theresa. It is dedicated to the patron saint of Petrinja, St. Lawrence. Originally classified as a monument of the highest category, the church was completely demolished during the occupation from 1991 to 1995. On its foundations, a new church was erected, faithfully replicating the design and architectural decoration of the former church down to the smallest detail. Saint Lawrence was born in Spain around the year 225. During his education, he encountered Pope Sixtus II, who was impressed by his faith and brought him to Rome, ordaining him as an archdeacon. After the prefect of Rome captured Pope Sixtus and sentenced him to death, the Pope instructed Lawrence to distribute the Church's wealth to the poor of Rome. Following the Pope's execution, the prefect demanded Lawrence to hand over the Church's wealth. In response, Lawrence brought the poor of Rome, declaring them as the true treasure of the Church. Offended, the prefect ordered Lawrence to be slowly roasted on a gridiron and thus executed. According to reliable written sources, the martyrdom of St. Lawrence occurred in Rome on August 10, 258 AD. In honor of Saint Anthony of Padua, the Franciscans erected a church and monastery in 1694, and in 1729, construction began on a new stone church. The construction lasted 17 years, and the church and monastery dominated the village of Hrvatski Čuntić as a cultural monument. Throughout history, it was often destroyed, including in 1991. Today, it has been restored to its original form. The Franciscans are a Catholic order founded by St. Francis of Assisi according to the rules of the mendicant order. The first order of Franciscans is a male order characterized by strict renunciation of all property and life lived through gifts and personal labor. The second order of Franciscans is the female order of the Poor Clares, while the third order is mixed and founded for laypeople. Franciscans of the first order arrived in our region in the early 13th century, and in Hrastovica in the 15th century. The Turks burned down the monastery when they conquered Hrastovica in 1591. The Franciscans returned to Hrastovica a hundred years later and were instrumental in founding the first public school in Petrinja around 1700. They also cultivated music, especially organ building. A new Franciscan monastery was built in Hrvatski Čuntić and restored after the destruction in the Homeland War."
163,Petrinja,Parish Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"The Romanesque-Gothic church in the village of Gora from the early 13th century was built by the Templars, members of the knightly monastic order. One of the oldest churches in the entire Zagreb Archdiocese is first mentioned in 1201. The church was among the first to be baroquized in the then Banska Krajina on a medieval defensive site. For centuries, the church has been visited by numerous pilgrims, and in 2013, it was declared a Marian sanctuary of the Diocese of Sisak. Parish Church of St. Bartholomew the Apostle Built during the time of Bishop Juraj Haulik from 1840 to 1843, it stood in the central square of the village of Hrastovica. A category A cultural monument was completely demolished during the occupation from 1991 to 1995. With the return of the locals to their native village, the church was rebuilt on the same site according to the original structure."
163,Petrinja,Parish Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord,"The Parish of the Transfiguration of the Lord was established on August 6, 2011, by the decision of the Bishop of Sisak, Monsignor Vlado Košić. The parish was founded in the area of the former parish of St. Lawrence in Petrinja and encompasses the settlements of Mošćenica, Nova Drenčina, Kolonija, Češko Selo, and Slatina. The first parish priest appointed was Reverend Josip Samaržija, with Reverend Janko Lulić serving as the vicar (chaplain). Construction work on the new church began in 2015, and the majority was completed by 2022 when it was consecrated on the feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord on August 6th. The consecration of the church was carried out by Bishop Vlado Košić of Sisak. The parish church is a tall building, elongated in rectangular plan with a bell tower situated above the facade. Inside the church, a dominant feature is the golden mosaic created by 17 workers from the Centro Aletti community in Italy. This mosaic represents an artistic masterpiece signed by the expert, Father Rupnik, a Jesuit from Slovenia."
163,Petrinja,Sights,"Monument to Stjepan Radić On October 25, 1936, the first monument to Stjepan Radić was unveiled. Approximately 30,000 people attended this historic event for the town of Petrinja. It is a historical fact that Petrinja was the first town to immediately form a ""Committee for the Erection of the Monument"" and initiate fundraising and implementation right after the tragic death of Radić in 1928. The monument to Stjepan Radić was sculpted by the artist Mile Vod, who was also the first woman to create a public monument in Croatia."
163,Petrinja,City Bathing Area,"In the distant year of 1902, the first city bathing area was established near the confluence of the Petrinjčica River and the Kupa River, which later became a permanent bathing spot in 1921. The current building of the city bathing area was constructed in 1942. The Kupa River near Petrinja is wide and calm, offering relaxation and refreshment from the summer heat with its clean water and beautifully landscaped banks. Various amenities and programs are available at the bathing area during the summer months."
163,Petrinja,Strossmayer Promenade,"The park in the city center was shaped in the early 19th century with valuable plant inventory, among which the Illyrian linden trees stand out. These linden trees were planted by Napoleon's army during their stay in Petrinja (1809-1813). Alongside the linden trees, the park features the rare Ginkgo biloba tree, known as a living fossil because it is the only organism to have survived the ice age. Dominating the city park is the parish church of St. Lawrence, the city's patron saint. The original church building from 1780 was completely destroyed during the Homeland War and rebuilt in its original architectural form in the 1990s.

The name Petrinja likely comes from the Latin word ""petrus,"" meaning rock, stone, or cliff, and may be linked to one of the ancient Roman settlements in the stone-rich areas of the Zrinska Gora."
163,Petrinja,History of Petrinja,"The history of the town of Petrinja and the Banovina region as a border area has left numerous traces in its cultural heritage. Among the protected cultural heritage, the most significant is the historic core of Petrinja, consisting of a series of single-story houses and public buildings that encircle the central city park. These structures are built in the style of late Baroque and Classicism. On the present location of the town, the continuity of settlement can be traced back to the year 1592 when a Turkish fortress was built at the confluence of the Petrinjčica and Kupa rivers. This fortress was demolished in 1728. Beyond the fortress, in the first half of the 18th century, suburbs such as Kaverlin, Majdanci, and Kaniža already existed. The second half of the 18th century was marked by economic growth and development, influencing a flourishing of construction activities and the expansion of the town from 1788 to 1793. During this period, the main streets of the town as we know them today were formed, featuring recognizable examples of Baroque and Neoclassical architecture."

163,Petrinja,Pottery and ceramics,"Pottery is considered the oldest, most widespread, and most famous craft in Petrinja due to its very high-quality clay deposits. Its heyday was in the mid-19th century when there were around 100 craftsmen. Pottery likely flourished thanks to the high-quality and widely renowned Petrinja clay, which supplied both the Academy and the School of Applied Arts in Zagreb. The renowned sculptor Mila Wood worked with Petrinja clay and created the monument of Stjepan Radić (1929). This clay monument was fired in the workshop of Šandor Stanešić and later cast in bronze and erected in Stjepan Radić Square in Petrinja (1936). Among the souvenirs, Stucka stands out - a ceramic vessel, once used for carrying water or wine, now one of Petrinja's traditional souvenirs.

As early as 1770, mineral springs were discovered in Jamnička Kiselica, and the first analysis of acidic water was made in 1772 by order of Empress Maria Theresa. After the analysis of the water in 1824, the campaign for the arranging of the Jamnica plant began, and in 1828, filled mineral water bottles were marketed in this part of Europe for the first time. Local experts recommend that you try the Jamnica mineral water mixed with wine or fruit juices. Jamnica is today the most common mineral water on the market in Croatia. Today's Jamnica facility does not offer the possibility of individual tours, but tours can be arranged for groups. Near the facility, for many years now, in mid-July, traditionally a fun and musical manifestation ""Kupske večeri"" has been held. Eco Park Krašograd In the village of Bratina, surrounded by beautiful nature, lies the Eco Park Krašograd.

The eco park is an ideal destination for an unforgettable family fun or outdoor sports gathering, as it offers a wealth of interesting content for children and adults. Within the zoo, children can see and pet horses and small ponies, roe deers, fallow deers, goats, sheep and poultry (ducks, small and big chickens). Titanic 100 Memorial House There were 2207 passengers and crew on board of the Titanic, a British overseas ship that sank in the Atlantic ocean in fatal 1912, including 30 expatriates from Croatia. Of these 30 from Croatia, only 3 survived, and one of the passengers was Stjepan Turčin from the village of Bratina near Pisarovina. To commemorate these travelers, the Titanic 100 has opened a memorial house displaying documents, pictures and items related to the Titanic. The objects are exhibited in a wooden house that is made in a traditional way typical for the area, and a small bow with the Titanic sign is placed in front of the house. Around the memorial house is the linden tree alley and Brezje forest, dedicated to expatriates from Croatia, as well as the friendship lake and the memorial to Carpathia. Carpathia is the ship that has rescued 712 passengers from the Titanic, and among them there were 84 crew members from Croatia.

165,Pisarovina,Customs and cultural heritage,"Legend Of The Construction Of The Parish Church In Donja Kupčina Today's parish church of St. Mary Magdalene in Donja Kupčina is connected with one story about its construction that was passed by word of mouth. At the time of the construction of today's parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, the area of Donja Kupčina and nearby Steničnjak was ruled by the count Drašković family. The beginnings of the construction of the parish church go back to the time when the said area was ruled by the countess Mary Magdalene Drašković. The parish church of St. Mary Magdalene is entirely built of stone. It is assumed that the stone used for the construction of the church is the already worked stone from Steničnjak. In the winter, when the Kupa River would become icy, they knew how to transport the stone over a river with a carriage. According to one legend, builders were often accompanied by one black dog. Local legend says that when the last loaded carriage passed over the Kupa river, the ice began to crack and that black dog drowned. The builders interpreted this as a sign of enough stones to build a church, which proved to be correct. Another interesting word of mouth story relates to the place where the parish church was built. The population then decided that the parish church should be built in the center of the village, which according to the rules should have been on the site of today's Konječićko Selo. When the masters brought stones to build the church, after the first day a miracle happened. The stones that were delivered to the defined place disappeared overnight and appeared on the site of the present-day parish church in Donja Kupčina. The next day, the builders continued to bring stones to today's Konječićko Selo, but every night these stones would mysteriously disappear and appear in Donja Kupčina. The population at the time interpreted this as God's will to build a church where there are more stones, and so the place to build the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene remained Donja Kupčina, and that is the place where the church is today."
165,Pisarovina,Legend Of The Origin Of Pisarovina,"There is one interesting legend about the origin of Pisarovina that is transmitted among the locals. According to this legend, the present-day area of Pisarovina was a count's estate where it is believed that a countess named Saraa, who was seriously ill, lived here. There were plenty of vineyards in the surrounding towns around the count's estate where countess Sara lived. Considering that countess Sara liked to drink, it is believed that her servants offered her wine with the words ""Pij Saro vina!"" (""Sara, drink wine!""). According to this legend, Pisarovina is believed to have been named even though it has never been historically confirmed. What is known with historical certainty is the fact that the Pisarovina fish ponds were created in 1918 on the swampy soil between Pisarovina and Donja Kupčina. The owner of these ponds was a countess from Italy, and the remains of her property are along the road near the pond, but are in very poor condition today and are not open to visitors. Wedding Customs In Donja Kupčina In the late 19th and early 20th century the marriage ceremony could only take place on the Sunday of Carnival (the Sunday before Lent) or the White Sunday (the first Sunday after Easter). For the sake of preparing for the wedding, the bride's and groom's families arranged and negotiated their marriage during the Advent, and by Christmas at the latest, they had to agree on all the details so that everything for the wedding could be prepared during Lent. At the midnight Christmas mass, the boys and girls carried a present to the person they liked - a Christmas apple which they gave to them after Mass."
165,Pisarovina,Cultural Heritage,"There is a long tradition in the Pisarovina area in the preservation of authentic cultural heritage. There are three cultural and artistic societies in the municipality: ""Bratinečko srce"" from Bratina, ""Magdalena"" from Donja Kupčina and folklore society ""Vrhovje"" from Dubranec parish. By collecting, processing and performing traditional songs and dances, these cultural and artistic societies participate in the preservation of the ethnographic legacy of the Pisarovina region. Folklore society ""Bratinečko srce"" is known as the guardians of the tradition of Croatian family cooperatives and is also a member of the International Union of Folklore Groups - IGF based in Nice, France. Folklore society ""Magdalena"" contributes to the preservation of Donja Kupčina's cultural heritage by performing traditional dances and songs. Folklore society ""Vrhovje"" from Dubranec parish is named after the place of the same name, and there is a tamburitza section and dance folklore groups for different ages within the society. At the end of the 19th century and early 20th century families lived in family cooperatives and lived predominantly from agriculture and animal husbandry. Somewhere around this time, Christmas customs are created, which we will mention below. At the beginning of the Advent, 4 weeks before Christmas, the faithful went to church every morning for the early services, thus preparing in prayer and fasting to celebrate Christmas. The morning masses in honor of the Mother of God are still held today in the churches at the time of Advent. Celebrating Christmas was bringing joy to the whole family because on that day everyone was gathering around a festive holiday table where housewives served food they had previously grown and cultivated in the field. At that time, the people were producing their own food and that is why all the flax production business (from which families in these areas lived) should have been completed by the feast of St. Andrew (30 November). The St. Andrew's Day was followed by a time of intense preparation for the celebration of Christmas, which included the preparation of bacon and ingredients for the Christmas roast. Christmas Eve must be fasted, as is the case today. At that time, women were preparing for breakfast fat dried flatbread with honey and roasted pumpkin, which was specially kept for the day. Men needed to cut enough wood for 2-3 days because it was not allowed to be done during the holidays. They also brought enough hay and straw into the house and barns to feed the animals in the coming days. On Christmas Eve, by nightfall, all the work had to be done. Then, traditionally in the dark, the oldest man in the family, invoking the blessing of God, brought ""Christmas"" into the central room of the house - a straw wrapped in a sheet, a pine branch, a bottle of holy water and a bowl of grain prepared by the landlady of the house. After praying together, the straw was scattered on the floor, and a bowl of cereals and a candle was placed on the table around which the family then gathered and began their supper. Everyone had to eat some garlic and honey to start with, and then came the thick noodles and ""gibanjik"" of cheese, because they were still fasting. After supper, the light was turned on and the candle went out. After dinner and decorating the pine twigs and pine trees, all the people went to the church for midnight Mass. After midnight, Christmas dishes such as roast pork, nut roll, gugelhupf and crushed cheese are brought to the family table. The housewives brought the little Christmas bread to the table on Christmas Eve and usually it stayed there until the Epiphany. On Christmas mornings, an aspic and dried flatbread were served with pork fat, and delicious roasts and nut rolls were served at lunch. After returning from mass, people hung out and spent Christmas singing, praying, and gathering. Christmas time ends with the feast of the Epiphany. At that feast, the priest at the mass was blessing bottles of holy water, which the faithful then carried to their homes to sprinkle their household and all other rooms in the house."
165,Pisarovina,Traditional Christmas Decorations,"The house was decorated with handmade ornaments, the most famous of which were roses and other crepe paper flowers. These handmade flowers were covered with pines, or pine branches, because of the cramped space in which the families lived, there was no room for the whole tree. Along with the flowers mentioned, an unavoidable Christmas decoration is a plaster bird hung in front of the pine. Some women made chandeliers of grain and various seeds and then placed it above the holiday table. In some families, they also placed an apple above the table. The apple loop was tied to a thread that was attached to a small wooden wheel attached to the ceiling beam and the other part of the thread was tied to the door. If the door was closed, then the apple would hang in the air, and as the door opened, the apple would drop to the table. For the Nativity scene, women also made sheep of clay or dough, which they would then wrap in a little cotton wool. For the legs of the sheep, they would place four used matches. These handmade sheep were then laid in a crib next to the image of Jesus, Mary and Joseph."

165,Pisarovina,Chapel Of The Holy Spirit,"The first mention of the chapel goes back to 1668, and according to the available data, a new chapel was built in 1704, and again in the 19th century. The wooden church from the 19th century was built in the traditional way. Today's wooden chapel dates from 1935. On the front is a shallow porch with a small bell tower. Inside the church there is a preserved small altar of folk Baroque style from 1749 with two statues (St. George and St. Florian) and an altar painting depicting the Coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The walls of the chapel feature the Way of the Cross, the work of contemporary painter and sculptor Mate Mihinica from the village of Obrezina in Turopolje region. There is also a statue of St. Michael surrounded by angels."
165,Pisarovina,Church Of St Mary Magdalene,"In the area of Donja Kupčina, near the Kupa river, there is a parish church dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene. The wooden church of St. Mary Magdalene was built in 1556, and four years later the bishop of Zagreb, Juraj Drašković, founded a parish in Donja Kupčina. The wooden church was replaced in 1672 with the brick church, and it has taken its final today's shape in 1749. That year, the late Baroque parish church was built thanks to the auspices of the Erdödy family from Jastrebarsko. There is also one interesting legend associated with the construction of this stone church. The church was destroyed in the Homeland War in 1991 and part of the church was rebuilt in 2007. The church is surrounded by the enclosure wall, and the space in front of the church is entered through a baroque portal. On the front of the church is a bell tower next to which is the main entrance to the church. The central building contains shallow side chapels with inventory dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. Above the church nave there is a domed vault depicting saints and ornamental motifs. Inside the church there is a valuable display over 300 years old. This parish church, one of the few in the area, is dedicated to St. Mary Magdalene who witnessed the Resurrection of Christ. July 22nd commemorates the day of St. Mary Magdalene. This day the Pope Francis raised to the level of the feast on June 3rd 2016, which was the feast of the Sacred Heart. Church Of St. Martin The Bishop The church of Saint Martin the bishop is located at the village of Jamnica Pisarovinska on top of the hill above Pisarovina. From this pearl of the local religious heritage there is a spectacular view of the surrounding settlements in the valley. The gothic construction of the church dates from the 13th century. Since 1642 the church was a damaged ruin and the new baroque single nave church was erected between 1740 to 1746. The church is surrounded by the walled enclosure. The interior of the church is dominated by a rich inventory of baroque and post-baroque features (altars and statues date from the 18th century). The main altar from 1741 completely preserved its Baroque wood-carved furniture, decorated with eight statues and ornamental motifs. On the side altar is a picture of the Fourteen Holy Assistants, made in the mid-18th century, and today occupies a prominent place in the artistic heritage of the Pisarovina area. The patron saint Martin testifies to the fact that this parish church was built by the French Templars, members of the crusade, who introduced their patron saint to the places where they were staying. St. Martin is also the patron saint of Pisarovina parish and municipality. The location of this church was chosen to rule and connect the entire area from Okić to the crossing on the river Kupa where the bridge is located. The wooden courtyard of the parish was erected in 1785 right next to the parish church. It is a house on the ground floor with a basement, which is built of wood and stone, and today is a rare example of the original construction of the Pisarovina area. Next to the entrance to the parish office there is a memorial plaque erected in honor of the Rev. Ivan Butorović (1899 - 1944), pastor in the parish of St. Martin in Jamnica Pisarovinska who was martyred during World War II."
165,Pisarovina,Chapel Of The Holy Trinity,"The Holy Trinity wooden chapel was built in the second half of the 18th century and was rebuilt in the 19th century. It is built of carved and sawn wooden boards in the traditional rural way specific to the wooden houses in this area. The bell tower is located immediately next to the front of the church, slightly recessed from it and rising from the roof. The preserved altars and partially preserved carvings on the facade date from the time of construction. The features of altar statues and carvings indicate that they were made in one of the Turopolje wood carving workshops. Chapel Of St. Vitus The chapel of Saint Vitus is located on a hill above the settlement Pisarovina surrounded by forest greenery and peace. This stone chapel was built at the turn of the 18th to 19th century. On the facade of the chapel is a niche with painted representations of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary, and partially preserved medallions with depictions of the evangelists. During the Homeland War the chapel was badly damaged and was rebuilt in 2013. Inside the chapel is the preserved part of the main altar from 1726, while the lateral rococo altars of St. Stephen and St. Anthony are being restored. Chapel Of St. Leonard St. Leonard's Chapel is located in the center of Gradec Pokupski, next to the fire station. Today's wooden chapel was built in 1938 in the traditional way that wooden houses (hiže) were built in this area. The chapel has a German embroidery. It was built on the site of an older chapel from which the main altar of folk historicist style is preserved. Inside the chapel is the altar of St. Leonard, which is the patron saint of rearers. Chapel of St. Anne On the initiative of the residents of Bratina, in 1993, started the construction of the chapel of St. Anne, and was completed in 1995. It was dedicated on July 27, 1995. It belongs to the Parish of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Kupinac. It was consecrated by Cardinal Franjo Kuharić on July 31, 2011. Fr. Željko Cestar, a Capuchin, celebrated his young mass there, for the first time in the history of the village of Bratina."

168,Plitvice Lakes,Birth of the Lakes,"Through the process of sedimentation of calcium carbonate and the work of special kinds of algae and moss, tufa or travertine has been deposited, and is still deposited to form the natural dams that separate the lakes. Since the process is going on today, just as it always has, new travertine barriers, curtains, stalactites, channels and cascades are being built and the existing ones are changing. As it is deposited, the tufa coasts the beds and banks of the lakes, giving the water sparkling beauty and petrifying trees and stones which fall into the lakes. The water keeps breaking through the travertine barriers at different places, so that the entire process of formation of lakes and dams is alive and very dynamic. This is, in fact, a continuous dynamic process of tufa formation, a unique, interesting natural phenomenon. Nature's construction work continues in undisturbed ecological conditions."

Culturally, it is a zero-category monument. The stone bridge in Lička Jesenica was built in 1876 and is preserved in its original form. The exact data on the construction of the bridge are not known, only oral tradition reveals that it was built by excellent stonemasons from Dalmatia. The bridge is protected as an immovable cultural property. In addition to these cultural treasures, one must also mention Funtana, the first water supply system of Saborsko, built in 1883, Čorkovo vrilo in Čorkova uvala, and many other monuments waiting to be discovered by you!"

This is a chance to get to know the best of Saborsko in just a few hours. The entire circular route is 12.9 km long and not too challenging.

169,Plitvice valleys,Barac caves,"During an hour-long walk, an expert guide guides visitors along the illuminated path between the majestic speleothems and tells them everything about the millennial creation of this underground treasure and valuable archaeological finds. Every part of this natural monument is completely fascinating, from the entrance and the Guano Hall, through the Elephant Feet Hall full of stalagmites, stalactites, and pillars (stalagnates) up to ten metres high, through the former habitat of the cave bear and Dragon's Throat, all the way to the Hall of Lost Souls. At the end of the visit, the story will stop for a moment and turn into absolute silence and darkness so that visitors could take that unique experience of the underworld with them forever. All visits are organised with a guide. The departure time is not predetermined, but is formed according to the arrival of visitors, and the waiting time for the departure is from 10 to 45 minutes. The temperature in the cave is around 9 degrees all year round so it is advisable to have suitable clothing and footwear with you. The Plitvice region owes its beauty, fertile land and fairy-tale environment to the mysterious karst underground, a part of which the visitors can experience by visiting Barać Caves. Of the 150 caves hidden in the underground of this area, only Barać Caves, after which the entire protected area was named, are open to the public. Coming to this destination and not visiting this miraculous work that Mother Nature has been shaping for millions of years would be a huge mistake."
169,Plitvice valleys,Deer Valley Ranch,"The magical place for which Plitvice Valleys are widely known is the Deer Valley Ranch, a unique outdoor zoo. The ranch spreads over 15 hectares and is home to more than 100 game animals that most people will never even see in real life, let alone get close to. In the Deer Valley, the timid deer and hinds, as well as stubborn fallow deer, eat from visitors' hands, allow them to pet them and take photos with them, and are especially careful with children with developmental difficulties, allowing them to come even closer. The Bićanić family, which is dedicated to caring for these graceful forest creatures, have no explanation for this. Animals, as the Bićanić family believe, simply feel instinctively, as do humans. The tour of the Ranch lasts about an hour and a half, which passes in an instant, followed by a collection of impressions and refreshments with homemade delicacies, natural juices and spirits produced by the Bićanić family and neighbouring family farms. Due to the great interest, the visit must be booked by e-mail or phone a few days in advance. The Ranch is closed on Mondays."
169,Plitvice valleys,Dreznik Old Town,"Drežnik Old Town is a magnificent defensive fortress from the 12th century that protected this part of Europe from the invasion of the Turks for 400 years. Due to its strategically important position, Drežnik often changed masters over the centuries, which left a mark on its walls, but 900 years later it still stands proudly as a witness to the turbulent history of this area. It is one of the few preserved historical attractions of the Plitvice Valleys that the Municipality of Rakovica has decided to protect and carefully restore. At the end of 2011, the large tower was restored, and since then the project of repairing the walls and roof of the large inner tower, as well as the remains of the defensive walls, has been underway. Although it is not possible to explore the interior of the tower in 2021, the glade where the fort is located is part of many cycling, walking, and horseback riding trails because this place offers a beautiful panoramic view of the Korana river and the surrounding area."

171,Podgora,Historic Heritage,"In 1962, on the slopes of Biokovo, just above Upper Podgora, a memorial Galebova krila (eng. Seagull Wings) was erected in memory of the Partisan navy founded in Podgora 20 years prior. The broken wing symbolizes the navy members killed in the battle for freedom, and the upturned wing symbolizes a climb to victory. Near the monument, there is a prehistoric site Three Tumuli, or four tombs of noblemen, which served as watchtowers (tumuli). The first three have been partially preserved, while the fourth one has been completely dug up, and the remains of the grave can be clearly seen. In Upper Podgora, there are also the ruins of the Roščić Tower. The towers were part of a defence system constructed in the 17th and 18th centuries for the purpose of defence against the Turks, and in the 1962 earthquake, the last remaining one, the Roščić Tower, was seriously damaged."
171,Podgora,Sacred heritage,"This small town is proud of its long Christian tradition, as evidenced by the large number of churches and chapels - as many as 20. Visit at least one, but know that each one tells its own story. The Baroque Church of St. Tekla was built in 1626, and it's characterized by a beautiful position - surrounded by nature, on the Cape of St. Tekla. In the church courtyard, you can see the remains of a cemetery from the period of Turkish raids. There is also the church of St. Roko with cemetery, both from the 17th century, and in that cemetery, they buried people who died of plague, according to local tradition. The church was heavily damaged in the 1962 earthquake, but the bell tower went missing before that, during the First World War, when it was used by the enemy army instead of cannon balls. In the church of All Saints, there is an altar with relics of St. Vincent, the patron saint of the municipality. The first Sunday after the Assumption of Mary (August 15th), a ceremonial mass is held in the church to honour the saint, and a large fair is organized in the town, which attracts a large number of visitors, even from the neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ijak Chapel/ Lighthouse is one of the most interesting buildings in Podgora, and is located on the Cape Ijak. It is devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary and, of course, to St. Nicolas, the patron saint of sailors. It used to be a perfectly functional lighthouse as well. Even the oldest villagers don't know when it was built, and it is sometimes mentioned as one of the oldest preserved Mediterranean lighthouses. The Chapel of Sacred Heart of Jesus is the most interesting historical site in this area. Along with a specific blend of styles - the Venetian baroque with local influences - it is one of the best-preserved sacral buildings. As part of a former complex, there is also a portal of the Mrkušić family summer house that once stood beside the chapel, and there is also a perfectly preserved coat of arms of the Mrkušić family in which, according to the Heraldic tradition, Dalmatia, where this noble family resided, is symbolically merged with that of their native Bosnia. It is also worth mentioning the Church of St. Liberan, the Church of St. George, the Church of St. Cross, the Church of Our Lady of Carmel, and the Church of the Assumption of Mary."

171,Podgora,Gastronomy,"As in any Dalmatian town, in Podgora, you can taste wonderful Mediterranean specialties in numerous places. The selection is varied, and the choice of restaurants, pizzerias, and inns is wide. In most restaurants, you can choose between traditional local, European, and Croatian cuisine, but we encourage you to follow the old advice from this area, which says that fish must swim three times - first in the sea, then in oil and finally in wine. You can trust us that this third item will not be a trial for you as local red wines are recognized as the best in the region and beyond. Here, you'll find the autochthonous Plavac and Pošip varieties, both of which are excellent with fish and seafood. The oils are top quality here because Podgora is known for its multi-century production of extra virgin olive oil that you can enjoy with sheep cheese, wine, fish or salad. For those who are really hungry, there is the authentic Dalmatian Pašticada (beef stew) and lamb, pod pekom (baked) or on the spit, whichever way you prefer. You can also take part in a half-day trip to the Dalmatian country, where you will be served the finest Dalmatian wine with beautiful views of the Red and Blue Lake and nature near Imotski. Podgora and Drašnice"
171,Podgora,About Podgora,"Podgora is a small town situated on the most beautiful part of the Adriatic coast - the Makarska Riviera. Life here has always been and remains dedicated to the sea, the same sea you can view as you walk on the long promenade stretching along the most beautiful Adriatic beaches. The experience of Podgora is felt simply by coming to this town. The approximately 1,500 people who live in this town still live for the sea, while along with maritime affairs and fishing, tourism has been booming here for the past 50 years. The bora from Biokovo, which protects this place, takes care of the bright and sunny weather, and allows you to enjoy the spectacular sunsets you will love to share with your loved ones. This small, vivid town can offer you far more than you could have ever expected. Enjoy the traditional ambience with all the benefits of a modern approach to tourism that we offer."
171,Podgora,The Uniqueness of Podgora,"Many people agree that this town, located at the very centre of the Croatian coast, is the most beautiful place on the Makarska Riviera. The sea in Podgora is crystal clear, and the beaches are ecologically clean. There is, of course, a well-known Mediterranean gastronomic offering, and there is modern accommodation and numerous entertainment and sports venues that can make your vacation even more fun. The uniqueness of the Podgora beaches, stretching over some 5.5 kilometres of coastline, is the result of a special connection between Biokovo and the sea. For thousands of years, the most beautiful pebble beaches of this part of the coast have been created by various natural processes. In the greater Podgora area, there is an unknown, very large number of fresh water springs, and many of them have been nicely fixed up and walled off. The water wealth in this area was one of the reasons this area was populated very early. In the early 20th century, the streams that sprang out of them powered up to 24 mills, and the traces and cracks caused by the earthquake are still seen today. Once the symbol of Podgora, the so-called Passage of Happiness was located on Sutikla. A rocky arch used to surge over the passage along the sea until an earthquake in 1962. Unfortunately, the earthquake demolished it, but the locals still call it the Road of Happiness. In the ruins of many older houses in Podgora, you will easily find copper coins, which are part of our beautiful history. Since the time of the Venetians, the locals traditionally laid copper coins under the thresholds of new houses, which, according to tradition, brought happiness to that house, and the custom was maintained until the mid-20th century. One of the most famous local legends tells the tragic story of Tekla. While at sea, a girl named Tekla died on a sailboat, and her father, broken by the loss of his only daughter, refused to throw her in the sea according to tradition. Sailing in the vicinity of Podgora, he found a spot that resembled a ship, its cypresses resembling a mast, which is where he buried his daughter, and it was, according to tradition, the first grave in the town that is today called Punta of St. Tekla. There are many other local legends and remains of the ancient times, some of which you can still enjoy today. There is never a lack of stories in Podgora. Drašnice The parish belongs to the municipality of Podgora in the Split-Dalmatia County. The town of Drašnice (Dračnice), located in the Uvala Sveti Križ bay, is first mentioned in the Turkish document dating from 1523. But the village existed even before, as evidenced by the medieval stećak tombstones, and the remains of the sarcophagi from the Roman period. From a long time ago, the parish has had two villages; one beneath the mountain and another one by the sea, called Kraj Drašnice is a little village located about ten kilometers south of Makarska, on the way to Dubrovnik. Today it has a population of just over 300 people, but at the end of the 19th century it had a population of over 900 people.The very name Drašnice comes from the thorn bush sort called drača žestica, which is an abundant plant in the wider area of Dalmatia. The place itself was first mentioned in the Turkish documents from the late 15th century. But the area of Drašnice was populated since ancient times. The remains of material culture in the area of Drašnice date back at least 8,000 years."
171,Podgora,Podgora City Centre,"The most popular beaches in Podgora are in the very city centre, and they offer a wealth of amenities. They are just down the promenade where you can enjoy the clean sea and strong sunshine with drinks and homemade cuisine. This place is always full of life, and it's easy to find good company and atmosphere or play ‘picigin'. The most famous and largest beach in the city centre is located in front of the well-known Medora Auri Hotel. It is also adapted for people with disabilities as it has an access ramp and a sealift. Plišivac Beach Just north of the city centre is the most beautiful beach of Podgora, Plišivac Beach. The pines surrounding the bay offer pleasant shade on the hottest summer days and surround the beach with the irreplaceable aroma of pine and sea salt. This beach is often full of people and entertainment, so we recommend it if you are looking for a party and good company. Dračevac Beach A few minutes' walk north of the city centre, you will find a 400-meter-long beach surrounded by dense pine trees. Dračevac Beach is a known nudist oasis for naturalists that offers privacy to anyone who wants it. On the beach there are no restaurants, bars, showers or dressing rooms, but the natural beauty will compensate for everything you thought you might miss."
171,Podgora,Garma Beach,"Small beaches in the coves of Garma are hidden. The sound of the waves and the chirping of the crickets are the only sounds you will hear. The beach is covered with gravel and stone, and surrounded by small cliffs and pine forests. The sea is a beautiful turquoise colour. Pláž Sutikla Sutikla Beach is located close to the camp of the same name, and has a large number of cafes and restaurants. The beach itself is narrow and often filled with young people looking for a good time they can always find here. The access to the sea is mild and perfect for a ‘picigin' game or two. The pebble beach in the south part of Podgora offers numerous restaurants and bars nearby, and plenty of natural shade from pine trees. The access to the sea is easy and gradual."
171,Podgora,The History,"Podgora was first mentioned as one of the towns under the protection of Venice after the Turkish defeat in a battle near Lepanto in 1571. At the cemetery near the church of St. Tekla, you can still see tombstones from that period. Despite first being mentioned only during medieval times, archeological artefacts testify to the existence of numerous settlements in this area for thousands of years, from prehistoric and ancient times, through the Middle Ages to modern times - probably due to its convenient position, mild climate, and stunning natural beauty. The name Podgora itself is obviously the result of location near the slopes of Biokovo. In order to repel Turkish invasions, this town was one of the primary strategic defensive points, which is why numerous towers were erected, and at that time the town had the ""title"" of Castello. The town is divided into two parts - Upper (Old) Podgora was built by the locals who, by retreating from the frequent hajduk attacks, fled to the slopes of Biokovo, seeking shelter. Lower Podgora (Kraj) was built largely after the fatal earthquake in 1962, which destroyed a large part of the town and countless natural beauties. The construction of Lower Podgora initiated the rapid development of tourism in this area."
171,Podgora,A Podgora Cultural Summer,"A Podgora Summer is an event for everyone, from locals to foreign tourists. Shows and musicals are regularly offered, as well as theatre performances for the little ones, pop music, classical music and klapa music concerts, fishermen nights, folklore shows, and there are also exhibitions all over. The locations where they are held are dispersed around town, predominantly on the terraces of hotels and bars, as well as on squares and beaches.a"

172,Podstrana,CHOOSE ACCOMMODATION FROM OUR OFFER,"If you stay in Podstrana, you'll reap all the benefits of a countryside holiday in the very heart of the Adriatic coast, at a location from which most of the must-see attractions and destinations in Central Dalmatia are easily accessible. As they are either located by the sea or on the slopes of the mythical Perun hill, most of Podstrana's accommodation facilities boast truly impressive views, while also providing you with the opportunity to set out on a boat trip or kayak ride, or perhaps a on trail or path that leads to one of Podstrana's many attractions or towards an attraction outside the municipality - from your very doorstep Birth house of Ante Kaštelančić Podstrana was the birthplace of one of the greatest Croatian visual artists of the second half of the 20th century, Ante Kaštelančić (Podstrana, 17 August 1911 - Split, 15 April 1989), painter, graphic designer and skilled art educator. He completed his initial education in art and formed his mature creative expression largely in Split, where he first learned painting from Emanuel Vidović. After this, he studied decorative painting in Munich, and graduated in 1935 from Ljubo Babić's class at the Academy of Visual Arts in Zagreb. He continued his studies in Paris, to which he would later return twice, while also visiting other cities during his study trips: Milan, Munich, Vienna, London, Prague and Venice. Although the entirety of the creative output of Ante Kaštelančić, by many considered the most authentic painter of Dalmatia, is today perceived as being dominated by the regional motif of boats and sails painted with strong, static strokes and expressive colours, his works - particularly those created up to the 1960 - also include multiple portraits, nudes, still lifes and paintings inspired by the towns of Orebić, Supetar, Trpanj, thanks to which he is known as one of the most suggestive painters of the Dalmatian landscape. Ante Kaštelančić's creative passion came together with a talent for pedagogy. He was a devoted art teacher and the founder of the Chair for Visual Arts at the Academy of Pedagogy in Split. For the hundredth anniversary of his birth, Kaštelančić's native Podstrana expressed its gratitude to his person with a retrospective of his work in the Gallery of Fine Arts in Split and the Art Pavilion in Zagreb.  A plaque was also placed on the wall of his house of birth in Gornja Podstrana during the same year."

172,Podstrana,PLATE WITH A VIEW,"The effort that tourism professionals put into their work while no one is looking is the most reliable indicator of the quality of their work. This is especially true for hospitality professionals who get their groceries from local farmers and producers, even more so if it is from the same households, because guests can immediately feel their effort in the fruits and dishes that find their way to their table. But even if they wanted to, the hosts at Podstrana could not hide most of their efforts. The abundant slopes of Perun, the green Podstrana coast, and the blue of its sea, where the Podstrana hosts reap and extract their treasure, are in plain sight whole year round, and the obvious beauty of the vistas in Podstrana is the first irresistible aesthetic guarantee of the quality offered by the local gastronomy. Even though the many centuries of heritage that enrich the hospitality and cuisine of Podstrana include influences from classical antiquity, eastern Mediterranean, and especially local, Poljica tradition, the gastronomy of Podstrana remains open to scientifically sound recommendations by nutrition experts, but also to, sometimes less sound, requests of modern guests, especially younger ones. All of this is carefully and thoughtfully included in the cuisine, menus, and offers of the hospitality professionals in Podstrana. The highest quality of genuine local groceries: fruit and vegetables, grapevines, olives, and seafood, as well as the guaranteed origin of those obtained elsewhere, are the foundations and true assets that represent the basis for the entire tourism image, and with that also the hospitality image, of Podstrana. The hospitality professionals will find their place in this image, each according to their desires and the type of establishment they operate, with their originality, their specialties, and their ""secret recipes"". Restaurants, taverns, pizzerias and confectioneries, pastry shops, fast food establishments, and coffee shops are mostly situated along the main thoroughfare in Podstrana, right on the beach or near the coast, and several of them are in great locations under a cliff, in the beautiful village of Stara Podstrana. You can enjoy the beauty of the scenery in and around Podstrana and the wealth of historical and cultural heritage, which are the basis for all of the tourism in Podstrana, while taking a walk and quietly taking in the view, but also while engaging in sports or recreational activities, or participating in an adrenaline filled adventure. The entire cultural and natural heritage of Podstrana provides an irreplaceable flavour to all the food and drinks served at Podstrana. That is why, without fear of exaggeration, we can say that guests choose the food establishments in Podstrana, regardless of the food they prefer, not only because of the view of what is on the plate, but also because of the view that can be seen beyond it. Enjoy!"

172,Podstrana,LVCIVS ARTORIVS CASTVS,"The life path of Lucius Artorius Castus is inscribed on the monumental stone that was placed at the entrance to his luxurious tomb in the Antique-period Pituntij (Podstrana) at the eastern edge of the territory of Salona - the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia. This is where he was buried, on his estate by the sea, at the end of the 2nd century. During the reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-138) and his successor Antoninus Pius (138-161), he performed important duties in five different legions and one imperial war fleet. He executed his greatest feats - command over the units taken into war against the Armenians and governing the province of Liburnia, founded as part of the defence operations against Germans - during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180). Lucius Artorius Castus began his military career as a regular soldier in the legion III Gallica, which was stationed in Judea during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. It was a part of the powerful Roman army that broke the Second Revolt of Judea in 135. As part of this legion, Artorius became a centurion in his thirties, and one of his superiors was Statius Priscus, under whose command Artorius will once again find himself around 30 years later."
172,Podstrana,Perun climbing area,"Located on the southern mountain cliffs under Velikim Perunom (448 m). One access point can be reached from the Strožanac - Sv. Jure mountain trail on Perunski, in the oak forest in the hinterland of Strožanac, while the other can be accessed from the Sv. Jure mountain trail on Perunski - - Sv. Jure na Vršini, which leads to the uppermost mountain plateau. The climbing area comprises several sectors with over forty directions with difficulty levels ranging between 4c and 8a. It features a preserved natural environment and is located in the vicinity of other tourist and recreational amenities in Podstrana.."
172,Podstrana,WHILE STOPPING BY IN PODSTRANA,"If you're just stopping by at Podstrana or have come here for a day trip from somewhere nearby, we recommend that you, after Sv. Martina and Gornje Podstrane, and, if you have the opportunity, climbing up to St George on Vršina, have lunch at one of the restaurants in Podstrana. Nobody should leave Podstrana without trying at least one slice of soparnik from Poljica (or ujenak from Podstrana)! DURING SHORTER (1-2 DAYS) STAYS IN PODSTRANA"
172,Podstrana,DURING LONGER STAYS IN PODSTRANA,"Polača Polača is the local name for both a place located in the interior of Strožanac and for the impressive remains of the polača (palace) located here, which apparently gave the entire region its name. These are the only remains of late Antique period residential architecture in Podstrana. The complex is situated on a mild elevation, in the immediate vicinity of a permanent source of potable water which, together with the dimensions (the walls of the ruins are about 5-6 m in height) and certain architectural features of this villae rusticae - the type of stone from which it was made, buttresses and the existence of a tiled floor - indicate that it could have been the centre of a huge commercial estate. There exist no unambiguous historical records that would reveal the identity of the owner of this polača. The opinion exists that such a lavish estate could have only belonged to a person of high importance in Podstrana during this period. The eminent Ausonius, who lived in the 5th/ 6th century, and whose funerary stela with the list of his titles, i.e functions (illustrious husband, dignitary of the honourable imperial council and perfect consul of Dalmatia) was discovered in the necropolis of St Martin meets this description very well. From the Cindro summer residence on the coast of Strožanac to Polača, there stretched an embankment which is believed to be the remains of a Roman division of land made during the period when the ager of Salona began expanding on the other bank of the river Žrnovnica, i.e. on the side of Podstrana. This long tradition in agriculture and microclimatic conditions in Polača are favourable for the cultivation of excellent varieties of vegetables, grapevines and olive trees, thus contributing to the affirmation of organic agriculture in Podstrana. The main mountain path in Podstrana passes through Polača. The path begins near the building of the Tourist Board, passes through the remains of Polača villaand leads towards the macadam road that passes through Gornja Podstrana towards the climbing area below the summit of Veliki Perun and towards the Church of St George on Perunsko peak."
172,Podstrana,Prehistoric traces,"Pišćenica Pišćenica is a large rock pile located above Gornja Podstrana. It is located about 1 km to the east of the Church of St George on Vršina, at an altitude of about 480 metres above sea level. It is cone-shaped and approximately 30 metres wide and 7 metres tall. It consists of rough rocks that have disintegrated into small pebbles on the top. From the southern side of this pile, on which subwalls can be noted, fragments of Illyrian and Roman ceramic ware can b found, which points towards the funerary and ritual origins of this pile. However, it could have also served as a strategic outpost, as it provided a view of the entire coastal and inland area and visual  contact with  other fortified positions on Perun, which was of essential importance for its builders. The border from Mutogras on the coast to the position of Krč in Dubrava, which delimited the territories of two Illyrian tribes - the Pituntines of Podstrana and the Nerastines of Jesenice - also passed through Pišćenica. Marked hiking trails from Gornja Podstrana and the Church of St George on Vršina  lead to Pišćenica."
172,Podstrana,Vilanjski grad,"Vilanjski grad is a fort located in the middle of a rocky plateau located to the northeast of St Georg. It is about 10 metres tall and is surrounded by two dry stone walls, of which the lower is much larger and wider. The position of this fort and the orientation of its most massive parts points towards the conclusion that it could have functioned as a border between the pastures of Illyrian tribes - the Pituntines of Podstrana and the Nerastines of Jesenice, whose inter-tribal border passed through this area. Although no marked hiking trails lead to the fort, access is possible. Obloženica is the largest prehistoric fort in Podstrana. Its shape is not circular, as is typical of ritual sites, but rectangular - which indicates that it was used for secular purposes, most likely as a shepherd's residence. It is located at the foot of Perunić peak (448 m), under which a marked hiking trail passes. Promenade by the Žrnovnica river and lungomare The promenade by the Žrnovnica river leads along its left bank, from its mouth all the way to Antonica's Mill in the neighbouring village of Žrnovnica. This pleasant, 2-kilometre-long pebbled trail owes its great recreational value to its excellently preserved natural environment, particularly its high vegetation and the vegetation of the river bank (poplar and willow trees). It is well-suited for walking, running and cycling. The largely pebbled six-kilometre stretch of the Podstrana sea coast functions as a beach throughout nearly its entire length and is equipped with recreational facilities and equipment. Off season, it is perfect for recreational walks and relaxation. The lungomare of Podstrana begins in Strožanac, near the mouth of the Žrnovnica river and continues to the southeast border of the municipality. This promenade is also well-suited for running and cycling. Reading Room /Čitovnica/ in Gornja Podstrana The building of the Reading Room in Gornja Podstrana was built in 1912 at the initiative of the priest Petar Car who , together with the Church council of the day, decided to build a common aegis for all cultural and social events in Podstrana in place of the ramshackle church building. A solid two-storey building made of stone was erected, and a local music society - The Croatian Catholic Educational Society, founded in 1907 - immediately began making use of it. In addition to music events, various folk plays were also held in the building of the Čitovnica. Multiple cultural events of all kinds - art exhibitions, poetry evenings, music events and theatre plays with sets that are not too demanding  - utilise the rooms of this building and the open terrace on its east side. The air of elegant simplicity of this historic building, the beautiful view of the sea and Perun Hill that its windows and terraces offer, and the authenticity of the profane and sacred architecture in its immediate vicinity together create the unique, magical atmosphere of the Reading Room as a hub of cultural life in Podstrana."
172,Podstrana,St Martin,"Sveti Martin (St Martin) is an archeologically very rich and historically complex village in Podstrana. The remains of the architecture of the Antique period commercial and residential complex in the regions of Javor and Vinina and fragments of tools for processing grapes and olives, together with the numerous stone fragments and objects found around the Church of St Martin indicate the existence of the Roman settlement of which, in contrast to the Illyrian Pituntium, was not erected on a hill but by the coast, alongside the Roman thoroughfare that passed there.  The Antique period necropolis with over twenty-five inscriptions, most of them tombstones with the names of individuals and details on their lives and family trees make the St Martin locality an abundant source of information on the history of Podstrana during Antiquity. The most famous name from the St Martin necropolis is that of Lucius Artorius Castus, which is mentioned in two inscriptions from the era of the emperor Commodus in the late 2nd century AD. One of them is of simpler content and construction and was most likely displayed in a public place, while the other is chiselled into a tomb stela decorated with rosettes and tendrils and used to be part of a larger monument. The original stela is now kept in the Church of St Martin, while a replica stands on its original site, between stone blocks in the enclosing wall of the church. The text details an impressive list of the increasingly eminent military functions that Lucius Artorius Castus achieved during his stellar career, and it reads as follows: To the divine shades, Lucius Artorius Castus, centurion of the Third Legion Gallica, also centurion of the Sixth Legion Ferrata, also centurion of the Second Legion Adiutrix, also centurion of the Fifth Legion Macedonica, also chief centurion of the same legion, in charge of the Misenum fleet, prefect of the Sixth Legion Victrix, commander of two British legions against the Armenians, centenary procurator of Liburnia with the power of the sword. He himself for himself and his family in his lifetime. A somewhat more modest list of titles of the state hierarchy of the day was awarded to Ausonius (illustrious husband, dignitary of the honourable imperial council and perfect consul of Dalmatia), another great historical figure from Podstrana from the 5th/6th century. The inscription with his name and functions was recently discovered in the region of Brdina, near the Church of St Martin."
172,Podstrana,Traces of Old Slavic mythology,"Together with the neighbouring Žrnovnica, the toponymy of Podstrana has preserved an unusually rich network of authentic traces of the sacral Old Slavic interpretation of the landscape.  Perun, Snake Rock and Our Lady of Sita are the key toponyms of Old Slavic mythology, which was brought to Podstrana by the newly-settled Croats in the 7th century, but whose roots can be traced back to ancient Indo-European times. This network of ancient Croatian toponyms is a living witness to the authentic culture and worldview that the Croats espoused all the way up to their Christianisation, and marks the first chapter in the history of Croatia. The remains and traces of these ancient cults and shrines connect Podstrana not only with other localities of the same content on the territory of Croatia - for example, the Istrian Perun on Učka Mountain, but also with a number of similar localities located throughout Europe and Asia that have been profoundly influenced by the language of the Old Slavs, their toponymy and interpretations. The authenticity of these localities is one of the strongest assets of Podstrana's cultural and tourism offer."
172,Podstrana,Perun,"Perun is the name of the most powerful Old Slavic god to whom hilltops were dedicated in Old Slavic interpretations of the landscape. In Podstrana, Perun is the name of the northwest part of the coastal side of Mosor and its peaks above the mouth of the river Žrnovnica and Strožanac: Perunsko (441 m), Veliki Perun (443 m) and Perunić (448 m). Perun's shrine was, according to all evidence, located on the westernmost of them, Perunsko, as part of the prehistoric fort ˝Duga gomila˝ Perun was envisioned as a mighty god of thunder that dispensed justice and maintained order in the world from his high throne in a city on a hill (or on a dry branch atop the bough of a tree). After the Christianisation of the Slavs, churches dedicated to those saints with features that corresponded the most to that of Perun were erected on his former shrines, in accordance with the religious tradition of the day. This was, primarily, St Elijah, followed by St Michael and St Vitus. Among the Christianised Slavs,St George, a popular saint that is the patron of many Christian communities, replaced Perun's son Jarovit (Jarilo), the young god of spring with whom numerous beliefs and customs were connected. However, in some places churches dedicated to St George were erected on Perun's cult sites, as is the case in Podstrana, thus representing a continuation of sorts of the worship of both deities."
172,Podstrana,Snake Rock,"The first known mention of the toponym Snake Rock can be found, in its Slavic form Smicamic, in a document from Split dating back to 1178 as the name of a place on Perun Hill by the Žrnovnica River, from which its old Croatian form Zmij kamik was derived. In this serpentine rock, the mythical worldview of the Old Slavs saw the god Veles, Perun's adversary, in an attempt to seize his throne on the mountaintop, thus provoking the climax of the Old Slavic mythical drama. As legend has it, the world is ruled by order, justice and benevolence as long as the sky god Perun and the underworld god Perun are located on opposing poles of the sacred dichotomy of up/down.  When this relationship is disturbed and the world falls into chaos, the fight between the gods begins, and the thunder god Perun begins to strike Veles, an angry beast in the form of a dragon or snake, with thunder and lightning until he retreats back to the underworld where he belongs and order is restored to the world once again. Perun killed the Veles of Podstrana and threw him into the nearby willow (˝rakita˝) and mud (˝blato˝), which are the names that these places bear today. The Snake Rock of Podstrana shares the fate of many of Veles's shrines throughout Slavdom, which became associated with evil (satanic) attributes. Thus it was devastated and left to oblivion, until it finally gained protection as a cultural and historical monument from the earliest period of the presence of Croats in this region."
172,Podstrana,Our Lady Of Sita,"Our Lady of Sita is yet another toponym that cannot be understood without reference to the Old Slavic mythological context. ˝Sita˝ or ˝šašika˝ is the Croatian name for a plant from the Juncus genus, from whose stalks various woven household objects, such as baskets and sieves, were crafted, and which grew in abundance in the once-marshy area at the foot of Perun Hill, near the estuary of the Žrnovnica River. Marshy soil, swamps and their specific vegetation are features that are, in Old Slavic Religion, ascribed to the goddess Mokoš (the Old Slavic word ˝Mokošь˝ is derived from the verb ˝močiti˝, which means ˝wet˝). In Old Slavic religion, Mokoš was worshipped as the Divine Mother, ˝the mother of wet soil˝, and was imagined as an indefatigable weaver that resided at those locations where the stalks of the plants used for weaving were left to soak. As a toponym derived from ancient Croatian mythological toponymy, the syntagm ˝Our Lady of Sita˝ preserves a part of the secretive network of relationships of this mythical world. The church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary was, therefore, built on the cult site of the most important female mythical figure of pre-Christian Croats, at the foot of Perun Hill, thus preserving not only the continuity of the sacredness of this locality, but also the continuity of its name."

A stroll through the city of many thousands of years reveals various styles and cultural influences which contributed to the formation of today's city with each step. The whole old city centre is a living cultural monument. The facades of numerous city palaces will reveal the history of their construction to you through various stylistic and historical periods. In numerous records and literature Poreč is called a city of mosaics thanks to the culture founded by the Euphrasiana, a basilica in whose diocese the museum of church art and archaeological remains of earlier churches are housed. The valuable museum collection of the Heritage Museum of Poreč and its Surrounding Area bear witness to a tradition of living in this area through many centuries. Along with museums, Poreč's streets are home to numerous atelier galleries and exhibition spaces which tend tradition in a modern way with their displays."
174,Poreč,Euphrasian Basilica,"The Euphrasian Basilica is not only an important local cultural and historic landmark in Poreč but is also considered one of the most beautiful and well-preserved monuments of early Byzantine art on the Mediterranean. It dates from the 6th century when Bishop Euphrasian, for whom the basilica is named, commissioned its construction at the location of an older basilica. The complex of the Euphrasian Basilica includes the Basilica itself but also the baptistery, atrium, bishop's palace and remains of sacral buildings and mosaics which date from between the 3rd and 5th centuries. The basilica was built in Byzantium style. The mosaics that decorate the face of the church and its interior, fall into the category of the most beautifully preserved works of art of that kind in the world. . In addition to the archaeological ruins and mosaics that date back to the 3rd century there are valuable religious monuments and artifacts from early Christian, early Byzantine, and medieval periods. The whole complex in December of 1997 has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage site."

The Street Art Poreč festival is another fantastic summer event that additionally livens up the town streets and squares with impressive performances that are both funny and surprising, sometimes even confusing, but undoubtedly a feast for the eyes and ears of passersby. It is precisely Poreč's narrow stone alleys that encapsulate all the magic of the town, lovingly nurturing the spirit of old times and offering a real treat for all your senses. A stroll around Poreč's old city centre The urban design of the Roman settlement that became Colonia Iulia Parentium in the 1st century is still recognisable today as the unique remnant of a classical Roman urban structure on the Croatian Adriatic coast. The longest central street, the Roman Decumanus Maximus, has remained just as it was when the city was built, and it has even retained its name - Dekumanska street. It continued onto the Roman Decumanus Agri, a road that led from town to the surrounding agricultural estates. The town survived for two millennia, passing through periods of prosperity and decline. The preserved structures from various periods help us to interpret its long past. The first town statute from 1264 has also survived, and what time has hidden with new buildings or accommodations to the modern urban lifestyle is now slowly resurfacing. The last significant detail of historic Poreč was uncovered in early 2005 during the infrastructure and stonework renewal project. Visit the old town of Poreč and enjoy a pleasant walk and seeing historical monuments and cultural riches. We recommend: Decumanus and Cardo Maximus streets, Pentagonal Tower, the Euphrasian Basilica, Marafor, the main town square, Roman Forum with antique temples, Romanesque house and gothic palaces from the times of Venetian rule, Baroque Istrian assembly."

179,Town Prelog,Sacred heritage,"Parish Church of St. James Parish Church of St. James the Elder Apostle was first dedicated to St. Lawrence the Martyr, as reminded by today's church of St. Lawrence in Cirkovljan. Since 1650, the parish church in Prelog has been mentioned under the title of St. James the Elder Apostle. The new church in the Baroque style was built from 1758 to 1761 and is one of the most beautiful Croatian Baroque churches. The vault of the church with domes above the spacious hall of the church nave is the first of its kind in Croatian church architecture. A three-part altar in the sanctuary of the church with the figures of St. James, St. Joseph and St. John of Nepomuk, as well as the altar retable (the area behind or above the altar, ie the frame for the altar painting) are a masterpiece crafted by Josip Herman and Vid Koeniger, Baroque artists from Graz. The interior of the church was painted in 1813 by the Italian painter Aloysius Belli, and the altarpieces for the side altars of St. Rosary and the Holy Three Kings were painted in 1869 by Giacomo Brollo from Germona di Friuli in Italy. The church was thoroughly renovated in the period from 1987 to 2008. Church of St. Roch Church of St. Roch in Draškovec was first mentioned in a canonical visitation in 1774 as a new parish chapel in Prelog. Famous historian Vladimir Kalšan mentiones in his monography ""From the religious life of Međimurje"" that its construction was completed in 1779, and it became a parish church in 1790. Initially, it had only one tower, but in the visitation from 1882, it was mentioned that another tower was built. Next to the church of St. Jerome in Štrigova, the parish church in Draškovec is the only one in the area of Međimurje County to have two towers. As pointed out by Kalšan, St. Roch was to protect against the plague that was ravaging the livestock at the time, which resulted in the impoverishment of the population. The parish of St. Roch in Draškovec has 25 sacral buildings: a parish church, six chapels, five worshiping altars, four pillars and nine crucifixes. Church of st. Roch in Čehovec Until 1789, the village of Čehovec was part of the parish of Prelog, and then, with the reorganization of the parishes of the Zagreb diocese, it belonged to the parish of Sveti Juraj in Trnje. Chapel of St. Roch in Čehovec was built in 1822, and in 1845 the chapel was rebuilt and enlarged. The new vault was erected by Michael Steinklauber in 1870, and two new altars (St. Roch and St. Florian) were erected in 1892. In 1915, B. Škarda from Brno in the Czech Republic made new windows of stained glass, of which the one next to the main altar stands out by depicting St. Roch. Chapel of st. Lawrence in Cirkovljan It is believed that this large chapel was built in the 14th and 15th century, given that the settlement Cirkovljan is mentioned in the first list of parishes of the Zagreb diocese in 1334. At the time of its construction, the church in Cirkovljan had a Gothic arched sanctuary, high and narrow Gothic windows and a Gothic triumphal arch, as well as rustic buttresses on the outside. It was probably a Templar church (of the French Templar monks, which the locals called ""red friars""). Unfortunately, only a partially preserved Gothic sanctuary with several walled Gothic windows remains visible in the today's appearance of the church. The chapel was thoroughly renovated in the Baroque style in the 18th century, and the year 1784, carved on the entrance portal, indicates the time of its baroqueization. The bell tower of late Baroque-Classicist insignia was built between 1813 and 1825, the sanctuary of the church was painted in 1793, and the nave in 1844. On the south outer façade of the nave is a sundial made by R. Balaš from Prelog in 1915. The sacristy, on the north side of the church, was added in 1784. The church inventory in the chapel dates mainly from the first half of the 19th century, and consists of three altars built of brown wood with gilded capitals, which is the work of Varaždin master Antun Pitsch from 1939. The organ was made by the Hungarian master Nandor Peperth in 1907. The chapel is surrounded by an iron fence which is a very valuable work of local blacksmiths. The chapel in Cirkovljan is the oldest form of medieval architecture in the Prelog area. Chapel of st. Hubert near Otok Along the canal of the newly built power plants on the Drava, a chapel was built in 1997 in honor of St. Hubert. The chapel was built by Prelog entrepreneur Stjepan Hrešć together with his business partner Fridrich Schertenleib from Altendorf in Switzerland, and on August 8, 1998 it was blessed by the Bishop of Varaždin Marko Culej. In the beautifully landscaped park near the chapel, a monument was erected to the inhabitants of Prelog who, in 1953, crossing the river in search of willow branches, drowned in Drava. The blue river thus became a tomb for 14 people from Prelog. Some drowned were never found."
179,Town Prelog,Treasure of Drav,"The area of Drava Treasure is a captivating corner of northern Croatia where landscapes, history, culture, and the cheerful spirit of three municipalities and a small town create a picturesque mosaic of plains, meadows, forests, meanders, and streams intertwining in the richness of natural beauty. Here, every village has its own story, and every crossroad is adorned with a ""pil,"" a wayside shrine that guards travelers and guides them on the right path. Each season brings its own enchantment - flowery meadows in spring, summer joys by the lake and along the old course of the Drava River, golden fields of wheat, corn, and sunflowers, autumn painted in vivid colors, and the peaceful winter idyll. Drava Treasure is a natural paradise where every adventure transforms into a unique experience in harmony with nature."
179,Town Prelog,The Museum of Croata insulanus Prelog,"The Croata insulanus Museum of the City of Prelog is located in the very center of the city, in a building built at the beginning of the 20th century in the historicist style. The permanent exhibition of the Croata insulanus Museum is based on a donation from prof. dr. sc. Matija Berljak to the City of Prelog. Donation of prof. dr. sc. Matija Berljak to the Museum Croata insulanus is divided into several collections: Collection of Naive Art, Collection of Modern Art, Collection of Ceramics and Collection of Binders. The museum material is presented to the general public, it serves to the education of the society and enables new insights into the cultural heritage through numerous exhibitions and events. Admission: free Bike ride on ""Preloga roads"" Sport and recreation zone ""Marina Prelog"" Company Marina Prelog was formed at the end of 2013 at the initiative of the City of Prelog with the aim of preparing for the most efficient management of the inundation space on the artificial lake. In addition to the company itself and a catering facility in the inundation area, there are several associations (Nautical Club Labud Prelog, Sport fishing club Glavatica Prelog and Kite Club Rode Prelog) which also contribute to the diversity of the tourism offer. Also, Marina Prelog is an ideal place to relax for many runners, cyclists, boaters and nature lovers who find a quiet place for rest and recreation in the inundation area and much needed space to ""escape"" from the relentless daily pace and business life. Marina offers Drava fish specialties, characteristic for this area."
179,Town Prelog,City of Prelog,"The City of Prelog has always been the social, cultural, tourist and economic center of lower Međimurje. In the last few years, the economy of the City of Prelog experienced intensive development. The city owes its development to changes in the socio-economic system, ie the strengthening of Prelog as an economic center, which is caused by a rich craft tradition, innovation, knowledge and capital. Although Prelog still has an active agricultural production, the main carriers of the economy of the City of Prelog are entrepreneurship and crafts. Čukovec The charm of old Međimurje villages deeply connected with nature has been retained in the village of Čukovec. Narrow streets with shade provided by century-old trees, densely packed houses, a few ground-floor houses from the end of the 19th century and the proximity of the forest are an ideal environment for visitors seeking peace, welcoming villagers and the mystique of the forest. The chapel of St. James is located in the center of the village and it was built in the second half of the 19th century. It is a place of rest and moments of tranquility for excursionists exploring the lower region of Međimurje. The narrow roads that pass through Čukovec will take you in several unexplored directions - towards Donji Mihaljevec and further to Sveta Marija, towards the old railway station and towards Draškovec. Paved paths around Čukovec are ideal for cycling, running, Nordic walking and rollerblading. On July 25, Čukovec celebrates St. James' day and holds a church fair. Draškovec The story of Draškovec, a village only a few kilometers away from Prelog, is closely related to the life mission of the Roman Catholic saint Roch (or Rocco), the protector against plague and cholera. Saint Roch was originally from France and lived in the 14th century. He renounced the wealth inherited from his parents and dedicated his life to pilgrimage and helping the sick and infected. He himself had the plague and was banished to the forest, where every day, according to legend, a dog brought him bread and cured his wounds. How is Saint Roch connected with Draškovec? In the 18th century (from 1743 to 1771), cattle plague roamed over Međimurje, which impoverished the population and caused numerous economic troubles. The rulers of Međimurje, the regal family Althan and their governor George Oszterhuber, sought salvation in their faith and made a vow to the saint. They've ordered the construction of the church of St. Roch in Draškovec. The church originally had only one tower and later another bell tower was added, making it only one of two churches with two towers in Međimurje (the other is the church of St. Jerome in Štrigova). Although Draškovec is mentioned in historical documents from the 13th century, we can continuously follow its history and development since the construction of the church of St. Roch at the end of the 18th century. The people of Draškovec still celebrate their saint every August 16, when Draškovec becomes a pilgrimage destination for believers from the surrounding villages and beyond. Draškovec is a quiet and idyllic village with about 400 households and is characterized by beautiful gardens, backyards and public areas. Sports and recreation are very important among the residents and football matches and fishing competitions are very frequent and well attended."
179,Town Prelog,Cirkovljan,"The settlement of Cirkovljan is mentioned in official documents as far back as 1334. According to archeological findings and records, it is believed that the church of St. Lawrence in the center of Cirkovljan originally served the Templars, ie the red friars, as they are still known in folklore - probably because of the red cross on their uniforms. The remains of the monastery found near the settlement are also attributed to the red friars. Of the Templar church in the center of the settlement, only a few stones and the frame of a Gothic window remain. The church of St. Lawrence was completely restored at the end of the 18th century in the Baroque style. History of Cirkovljan is intertwined with the history of Prelog - many historians believe that in the 14th century the position of Prelog was actually where the settlement of Cirkovljan is today, and Prelog developed later as a market place and a Drava crossing point two kilometers away from Cirkovljan. Every place has its church fair but only Cirkovljan has St. Lawrence's day! Cirkovljan celebrates its patron Saint Lawrence or Lovreče on August 10th each year with a mass and a fair with stands and tents under which visitors can refresh themselves with a glass of mead - fermented honey drink. The celebration of the saint is accompanied by an interesting astronomical phenomenon called Tears of St. Lawrence which reaches the peak of its activity in the vast night sky of Međimurje between August 11th and 13th. It is interesting that in the 18th century a large cattle fair was held on St. Lawrence's day in Cirkovljan."
179,Town Prelog,Oporovec,"A small quiet village of Oporovec is located along the Drava and its former sleeves. In the past, before the construction of the artificial lake HE Donja Dubrava, the village was probably a crossing point over the blue river. It is assumed that Oporovec was named after Opor, a feudal lord mentioned in a document from 1213. One of the possible interpretations of the name is also the historical fact that lords from nearby Ludbreg acquired the Drava island of Oporovec (Oporoch) at the end of the 14th century. The island was probably located along the Drava towards the village of Oporovec. The word opor otherwise means rough, but this adjective can in no way be attributed to the people of Oporovec. Around Oporovec there are hidden river sleeves, remainders of the former course of the river Drava, but also arranged ponds and hidden bathing areas. From the stories of our grandparents, we learn that flocks of geese, ducks and chickens used to walk through Oporovec. The inhabitants cleverly used the Drava backwaters for poultry breeding and today Oporovec is known for the Zadravec family and goat breeding. Due to its position along the Drava, Oporovec was often affected by floods. For centuries, the people of Oporovec have vowed to St. Nicholas for protection and in remembrance of those days, a statue of the saint is guarding the newly renovated park in the center of the village. Oporovec celebrates the day of Our Lady of the Snows on August 5, and the center of the village is adorned with the chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes, built at the end of the 19th century."
179,Town Prelog,Otok,"The village of Otok (meaning island), located along the Drava river, is adorned with preserved nature - swamps, forest and old river sleeves. The inhabitants of the village thus enjoy the shade of the woods, refreshment in the summer months on the river and the calmness of fishing in the ponds Perutnica and Graba Grabant, which was once the island's favorite bathing spot. If they are lucky, residents can even spot beavers building their dams in the nearby old sleeves of the Drava river. In the Middle Ages, Otok was probably a river crossing point that connected Prelog with the rest of Croatia and today there is a more modern bridge to Hrženica. Records of wooden bridges over the Drava tell us about past times when people were closely connected, economically and culturally, to the Drava and its abundance of plants and animals. Today, these backwaters, reefs and islands on the blue river can be seen and discovered by riding in traditional boats, accompanied by local fish keepers and experienced guides. There are two chapels in Otok, one of which was built along the canal in 1997 in honor of St. Hubert. In the beautifully landscaped park near the chapel, a monument was erected to the inhabitants of Prelog who, in 1953, crossing the river in search of willow branches, drowned. Drava thus became a tomb for 14 people from Prelog. The average age of the drowned was 36 years. Some bodies of the drowned were never found. On September 13 we mark the tragedy on the Drava by laying wreaths at the monument. The village of Otok organizes a church fair on June 10, when the Sacred Heart of Jesus is celebrated. Hemuševec Hemuševec was most probably named after the nobleman Hemuš whose brother Kazimir was the notary of the royal office of King Bela IV. The settlement is first mentioned in historical documents from 1226. That was a gift charter of the Hungarian King Stephen, which holds records of donated estates. The settlement of Hemuševec is closely connected with Draškovec to such an extent that the border between the two settlements would not even be noticeable, if there was no sign with the name of the village at the exit from Draškovec. In the Middle Ages, the settlements of Draškovec, Hemuševec and Donji Kraljevec belonged to a property called Rojc, and this fact is mentioned in a historical document from 1244. If Draškovec is characterized by newly built houses with large modern gardens and flower beds, then the landscape of Hemuševec is adorned with houses of older construction, leaning against each other, with narrow and long courtyards and traditional flower beds in front of the houses. The center of Hemuševec is adorned with a chapel dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, built in 1900. A traditional church fair is organized every year on September 9. For the local population, the church fair also represents the end of summer and summer holidays. Older generations will describe the church fair, with a sadness in their voice, as their last chance to drink a glass of mead for the year, a sweet refreshing honey drink that is traditionally sold and served at fairs. Čehovec Čehovec is the only settlement in the area of the City of Prelog that has a railway station. Memories of high school days and daily train trips to Čakovec are kept by numerous generations of the local population. Čehovec probably got its name during the settlement of Czech craftsmen and merchants in the 13th century at the invitation of the Hungarian King Bela IV. Although Čehovec is the official name of the settlement, the charming Kajkavian name is heard more often among the locals - Čavec or Čavci. The center of Čehovec, along with a few end-of-19th-century single-storey houses of traditional architecture, is adorned with the chapel of St. Roch, built in 1822. The interesting thing about the chapel is its unique position in the village center, since the whole street looks directly to the front of the building. The chapel stands proudly at the crossroads and seems to follow and guard the travelers on their chosen path. It originally had four bells, but all the bells were taken away during the First World War and were used to cast cannons and cannon bullets. The chapel also houses an organ made in 1861. It is recommended to visit the chapel during a sunny day. The refraction of light through the stained-glass window by the Czech artist Škarde is truly a special visual experience. The window at the main altar stands out the most and shows Saint Roch. Saint Roch, along with Draškovec, is also celebrated in Čehovec on August 16th. Prelog is connected to Čehovec by a road that is ideal for cyclists. Approaching the settlement from Prelog, visitors will get the impression that Čehovec is hidden in the green forests. These are the remains of once large forests that adorned the whole of Međimurje."

Old Town of Primošten The old part of town, nowadays called the Old Village (Staro Selo), was an island in the past. In the 15th century the people from the inland, the only inhabited part at that time, took shelter from Turkish invasions on the small island Capocesto (Bare Head) and connected it with mainland by a draw bridge, hence the name Primošten (pre-most-en, meaning ""connected by a bridge"").The narrow canal was eventually made into a causeway (the part of Primošten called Pisak) and the island became a headland. If cobblestone streets and old stone houses could talk, they would certainly tell a story or two!"

180,Primošten,Bucavac Vineyard,"This vineyard, situated on the hill Bucavac, 3 km south of Primošten, resembles lace and is often called stone lace. The small plots of soil, nourishing just a few grapevines, have frame-like stone borders of shallow drywalling to prevent erosion. This kind of land cultivation means that the plots can only be worked by hand. Because of this, the grape known as Babić, grown on Bucavac, is one of the most valued grape varieties in Croatia and this is not surprising not only because of the way it is cultivated, but also because of the small yield. Babić grapes attain their perfect balance on this sunny position on Bucavac and have the potential of making the highest quality wine. The intoxicating fragrance emanating from the rough and rugged vines, together with the strenuous labour needed to grow them, illustrate how passionate the local people are about wine and how much respect they have for the land. The Babić from Bucavac is a wine of the highest quality and an ambassador of Primošten. One tasting overwhelms you with the richness of tradition, a breath of the Mediterranean and the strength of the sun, sea, wind and of man. Cultural & historical monuments"
180,Primošten,The Parish Church of Saint George,"In the second half of the 15th century, due to constant Turkish attacks, looting and destruction, the people living in the inland part of what we today know as the Primošten region, at that time known as Bosiljina and the Parish of Prhovo, were forced to abandon their homes and seek refuge on the nearby small island called Capocesto (the Bare Head), now Primošten. They built a church on top of the hill in 1485 and Primošten became the centre of the new parish. Unfortunately, the Parish of Prhovo, founded in 1298, ceased to exist. The church was dedicated to Saint Mary after a local woman, Magdalena Butković, bequeathed a painting of the Madonna to the church in 1560. Saint Mary became the patron saint and protectress of Primošten. The other patron saint of Primošten is Saint George. He was also the protector of the Parish of Prhovo from where two bells were brought and gifted to Saint Mary's church by Andrija Gracić Gracin in 1685. On the foundations of the first church, a new one was constructed leaving only the sacristy as a reminder of the old one. In 1760 a completely new, big church was built and it was consecrated on 11th May. The date is engraved on the plaque by the main entrance. The church of Saint George is built of white stone. It has three naves and lies in the direction East-West. It has been classified as immobile cultural property and is listed in the Register of Cultural Heritage of the Republic of Croatia."
180,Primošten,Saint Rocco Church,"In the 15th and 16th centuries the people of Primošten were buried in the cemetery which was situated where the main town square Rudina is today. Funeral masses were served in the cemetery chapel, built in 1553, outside the settlement walls. The chapel was called the Church of Our Lady of Mercy. It was later enlarged and dedicated to Saint Rocco to whom the people vowed their devotion because he had saved them from the plague. A draw bridge was built to enable the inhabitants to get from the mainland, where the church was, to their homes on the island, hence the name Primošten from ""pre- most- en"", meaning ""connected by a bridge"". The bridge was in time replaced by a causeway. The Church of Saint Rocco is a rural, single nave, longitudinal church, without apse, facing North -East. It has a bell gable and an added sacristy. It is situated in a park where cypresses and the fragrance of Mediterranean vegetation enrich this haven for the body and the soul. The Church of Saint Rocco is protected as immobile cultural property of the Republic of Croatia. Statue of Father Ivo Šarić During the Second World War, Primošten was under Italian occupation. In 1942, the Primošten Partizan Unit killed eighteen Italian telegraphers on the hill Jelinjak. This caused retaliation and on 16th November 1942 Primošten was bombed. The day before the bombing, an Italian officer gave the information about the planned attack to the parish priest Grgo Roglić and the chaplain Father Ivo Šarić. They warned the people and made them hide in the fields and in the church. Some inhabitants, among them women, children and the elderly, were taken to the park with machine-guns pointed at them, while adult men were taken to Pisak (part of causeway at the entrance into Old Town) to be shot. The parish priest Grgo Roglić and the chaplain Ivo Šarić begged the Italian commanding officer to spare the lives of the people and luckily they were set free. The people were released, but the commanding officer asked for a ransom to be paid for the men. Some men were taken to prisoner of war camps and several houses were burnt down and destroyed. Thanks to the efforts and the courage of the priest and the chaplain a much greater tragedy was prevented. In 1991 the people of Primošten erected the monument to Father Ivo Šarić as a reminder of that incident. The statue is the work of the sculptor Ale Guberina and stands in front of the Church of Saint Rocco. Statue dedicated to Primošten peasants ""The barren land guards its treasure, it doesn't give much, but what it does give, is worth three times more."" These are the words from a well-known Dalmatian song giving us an idea of what it must have been like to work the land in the past. The Primošten region, also known as Dry Headland due to very little rainfall, is extremely rocky (karst terrain) with little soil. To grow anything in such conditions, the people of Primošten made small plots of land (vlačice) by manually removing rocks to harvest all available soil in one place where they would then do the planting. If they managed to find more soil in one spot, they would use donkeys to take the surplus to other places needing more. Land prepared in this way, where small patches of soil are surrounded by rocks that were dug out to find the soil, resembles lace. The best example of such stone lace can be seen on the hill Bucavac where the Babić variety of black grapes are grown. Every drop of wine produced from these grapes testifies to the hard work, determination and persistence of the Primošten peasant. In honour of the Primošten peasant, a monument was erected in 2007 near the entrance into the Old Town (Pisak) and is the work of sculptor Marko Gugić. Statue dedicated to Primošten fishermen In Primošten, fishing has always been a means of sustenance. The statue of the fisherman reminds us of the hard life fishermen had, particularly when working with fishing nets, as was usually done in the past. By the fisherman's feet there is a cat longingly looking at the fisherman and patiently waiting for its dinner as he empties his nets. The fisherman and the cat have become an attraction by the beach and tourists often take their photo with the beautiful view of the Old Town of Primošten in the background. In the past, fishermen had to be skilled in forecasting the weather. Before going out to sea, they had to know, among many other things, if the wind would change direction, so, as yet another symbol of the respect the people of Primošten have today for the fishermen of the past, a wind rose has been made on the path along the sea near the statue of the fisherman. If you like, you can check the wind direction while strolling by the beach."
180,Primošten,Statue of a fisherman with a harpoon,"At the entrance into the Old Town of Primošten, in the shallow water of the cove (Mandrač), alongside other boats, you can see a statue of a small boat with a fisherman standing on the bow trying to catch fish with a harpoon. The other man in the boat is rowing. The statue was erected to celebrate the fishermen of long ago and remind the new generations how important fishing was in the past. The boat is equipped with a lantern used for safer sailing and to attract fish. To make the statue more interesting, the lantern is powered and lights up at night. The statue was made by the sculptor Teo Baučić. Gastronomy in Primošten"
180,Primošten,Restaurants and taverns,"Restaurants: Fishing has been a long tradition in Primošten so that locally caught fresh fish prepared in different ways can be found on all menus. Sea-bass, bream, pilchard and red mullet are usually grilled and to experience culinary greatness you should try black cuttlefish risotto, fried squid or Croatian shrimp (škampi na buzaru). Taverns: Taverns used to be cellars where people kept wine and oil. Today such places are restaurants that offer a taste of the old times through their authenticity and gastronomical experience."
180,Primošten,Wine and olive oil,"Wine experience: Enogastronomy in Primošten is proud of its native Babić, a red wine of the highest quality known world- wide. Babić grapes are black and the dark ruby red wine made from them is dry, has a pleasant aroma and fruity taste. Guests visiting wineries can taste other quality wines and acquaint themselves with the rich tradition of wine growing and production in Dalmatia. Olive oil: Primošten is also well-known for its fantastic olive oil. Practically all families in Primošten have olive groves, predominantly the variety ""oblica"", left in legacy by their ancestors. Extra virgin, organically grown oil has its place on the plate of every healthy meal. Oil can be bought from the local producers."
180,Primošten,Our Lady of Loreto Lookout,"To provide an additional tourist attraction, the Primošten Municipaliity constructed a lookout on the hill Gaj. From the lookout, visitors can enjoy breathtaking sunsets and view of the town itself, as well as the surrounding islands and the islands of the Šibenik archipelago. In the middle of the lookout stands the statue of Our Lady of Loreto. Together with its base, the statue is 17 m high, precisely one tenth of the height of the hill. It is made of concrete, it is hollow so people can take a look inside. The outer surface is adorned with gold, silver and coloured glass mosaic. Aron Varga was the architect in charge of the project and mosaic master Milun Garčević worked on the mosaics with his team of experts. Thanks to the efforts made by the Primošten Municipality and the representatives of the Italian project ""Cammini Lauretani"", Our Lady of Loreto in Primošten is listed on the International Pilgrimage Routes of Marian shrines. On the list there many shrines; one of them is Trsat in Croatia and others are in Rome, Vienna, Krakow, Lisbon, Madrid, Paris, Brussels and many other European cities. According to Mr. Stipe Petrina, the Mayor of Primošten, the idea of a lookout on the hill Gaj dates back to 1972. The initial project was a restaurant on top of the hill. The project was later modified and the construction of the statue of Our Lady confirms the faith and devotion the people of Primošten have for the Virgin Mary. In 1835, Marko Prgin, a man from Primošten, saw a painting of Our Lady of Loreto in his dream. He borrowed a boat and sailed to the town of Loreto in Italy to find that painting. He found it and brought it back to Primošten, but it was not accepted by laymen. When a cholera epidemic broke out in Primošten, the Parish priest Mate Livić suggested to the people to accept Marko's painting and carry it in procession around the village. That was done and from that 10th May 1835 nobody died of cholera. The people of Primošten celebrate and honour Our Lady of Loreto as their protectress. At the lookout there is a cafe and a souvenir shop. During summer, concerts are held there. Primošten lace For centuries needlepoint lace has been an ornament on the scarf, blouse and undershirt of the festive costume of Primošten women. It was first mentioned in documents in 1550. Mrs Bruck-Auffenberg, the well-known Austrian researcher of traditional handcraft in Dalmatia, was overwhelmed by its beauty and uniqueness and in 1911 included it in the great exhibition of traditional art she organized in Vienna. It was also on the exhibition poster. Lacemaking is a skill young Primošten women learnt from their mothers. After an exhausting day of working in the fields and doing the chores, women would take their place in the candlelight or near the fire in the hearth and make lace on their cushions using an ordinary needle and white thread. They made up their own patterns, usually floral, transferred them on paper which they secured with thread onto their cushions, and using just a few different stitches they managed to create works of art they used to decorate clothes. We still admire the beauty and exquisite workmanship of lace on century old blouses which serves as inexhaustible inspiration to new generations of lacemakers who are faithfully following the tradition of their predecessors."

183,Pula,Unlock the door of the three-millennia-old history of the city of Pula,"The three-millennia-old city has been marked by many wars and losses, but also by settlements, construction and development. This rich cultural legacy is evident in every corner. This can all be seen in the rich cultural legacy that is gradually coming back to life owing to latest technology. Only a century ago, Pula was a city in which His Imperial Highness rode in an open carriage in the city's wide streets. The city successfully outlivedboth the Emperor and the Empire that dissolved in history, but that same history remained forever rootedin the urban tissue, mixed with all past and bygone times reaching as far back as the Roman Empire when Pula was in fact founded as a city. It is this particular Roman legacy, presently evident at each corner, that gives this three-millennia-old city special importance and beauty. From the unmissable Amphitheater, Gate of Hercules and Twin Gates, the Small Roman Theater to the Triumphal Arch of the Sergi, a chance traveler can follow the development of the city in the south of Istria, follow the splendor of life of the time. The mosaic Punishment of Dirce, a little off the road in Sergijevaca Street, covers 65 square meters. It's a preciousartifact from the 2nd or 3rd century AD whose value can be compared to only two motifs: The Farnese Bull kept in Naples, and Dirce, known as part of the fresco cycle about penitent women from the Vatican Museums. The Byzantine period is followed by the arrival of the Slavs, the Frankish rule, until the rise and arrival of the Serenissima, i.e. Venice. The true embodiment of the legacy from this period is the City Hall, presently with the same function, in the main city square, the Forum, along with a couple of churches. It is interesting to remind that this is when the famous Italian poet, Dante Alighieri visited Pula. After the fall of the Serenissima, Pula came under Austrian, French and once again Austrian administration. This is when Pula facedthe decisive ruling of the Imperial-Royal administrationabout the special status of its port in the Habsburg Empire. This was marked by the arrival of Empress Sisi and Franz Joseph to Pula and the laying of the foundation stone of the Pula shipyard. It is interesting to know that with the arrival of Robert Koch to the Brijuniby invitation of Paul Kupelwieser, the marshy area of Pula was desiccated and malaria eradicated. This was the time of construction of the waterworks, sewage, hospital complex, many buildings and villas, the defensive system of the important military port ... All this is still in use and can be seen at every corner. Perhaps the most striking is the system of underground tunnels Zerostrasse and fortresses Kaštel, Punta Christo, Verudelaandsome others, that can be visited. Since the establishment of the Croatian state, the present time, too, has been leaving its imprints. Namely, many militarybarracksare being transformed into Community Centers, among which Rojc definitely plays an important role.The Archaeological Museum of Istria, that, after its renovation and restoration, will reopen in 2021 as a complex together with the adjacent Small Roman Theater, meticulously storing even minor valuable particles of history.

184,Punat,Local customs,"Even in modern times, the town of Punat still maintains its old customs, which have their own charm and uniqueness. Through the cultural and artistic society, as the fundamental pillar of Krk's culture, traditional musical and dance expressions are nurtured, which, despite the challenges of modern times, are still jealously guarded. The repertoire of the folklore group consists of dances from all over Croatia, with a special emphasis on the dances from the island of Krk. The dances are performed in the original folk costumes of the area where the dance originates. The specialty of the folklore group is the authentic Krk tanac (dance), of which it is probably the best performer in the country. The dance is accompanied by the characteristic playing on a small (thin) and large (thick) sopila (instrument similar to the oboe), a non-tempered instrument that originates from the Middle Ages. Folklore performances are held in the height of the tourist season and always have a large audience which includes many appreciative foreign guests. Klapa singing is also associated with the folklore expression. Klapa singing is a form of originally male multipart singing of the so-called urban Dalmatian songs related to the music and poetry of Dalmatia and its original spirit. The songs are usually performed by a group - klapa, consisting of 5 to 9 singers. Singing begins with a solo introduction by the second, less often the first tenor, after which other singers join in, signing along with the lead voice. In the past, klapa singing was associated with Dalmatian kalete (narrow streets) and taverns in which the singers socialised with wine and fish while singing together. The klapa melodies are spontaneous, melodic, and memorable, and they glorify the beauty of Dalmatia, the coast and the islands, love, life, and the sea. Nowadays klapa singing is arranged to perfection and is popular along the coast and on the islands, representing Croatia's true musical treasure. Punat also has a long tradition of holding ""mesopust"" (carnival) in the winter months. This period is called the ""Fifth Season"" and the whole town participates in various carnival events: dancing, masked plays, youth processions, etc. with lots of socialising and fun."

The church of St. Roch was erected on the Nova Placa (part of the town of Punat) in 1855.  On the façade of the church there is a slab on which in the Latin language is written that the church was built on the holy glory of St.   Roch and St. Sebastian (Sv. Sebastijan).

The interweaving and intertwining of the ancient and contemporary atmosphere is an idyllic connection for an unforgettable visit to any magical place in the vicinity of Raša, a white town made of coal. Raša and surrounding places Raša It took only 397 days to build Raša, the youngest town in Istria, as one of the newly built-up towns (città di fondazione) during the Italian reign, i.e. the fascist era. The construction works begun on the 10th March 1936 and ended on the 10th April 1937, with the majority of buildings completed within a year so the first inhabitants started to move in their new homes, and the new town of Raša was officially inaugurated on the 4th November 1937 before the government emissary Giovanni Host-Venturi and the king's envoy Duke of Spoleto and other highly ranked state officials. By a special royal decree of Victor Emmanuel III, the statute of the municipality of Raša was created on the 28th October 1937 as a symbolic date which marked the fifteenth anniversary of the march on Rome. Initially, the newly constructed mining town was called Liburnia, but due to political circumstances immediately before the adoption of the statute, the name was changed to Raša, i.e. Arsia after the river of the same name, which with its tributaries geographically and morphologically determines this area. The river Raša (Arsia flumen), although of a small river flow, has from prehistoric periods until recent times often been a significant border boundary between different tribes, peoples, empires and states. Pulitzer has paid a special attention to the main square, which serves as the heart of the town. The square is dominated by an impressive church of St. Barbara with a specially designed roof construction made of reinforced concrete ribs set in such an order that they resemble a mine pitch hallway, as well as the squared bell tower resembles the mine lamp, which is also shown in the municipal coat of arms. The church interior is modern with simple, yet sophisticated details of the marble altar and stoups, spiritualized with side ceiling lightning, two high glass windows in the front façade and very interesting light effects in the side sacristy with a glass dome. A covered loggia, object often seen in many Istrian towns, is located right next to the church. Its vaults should have helped the airflow on the square during summer. The front façade of the church includes a stone relief depicting St. Barbara, made by a Trieste sculptor Ugo Carà. The square was once decorated with a supernatural statue of a miner warrior created by a famous Trieste sculptor Marcello Mascherini, but the statue was demolished soon after the end of World War II. Pulitzer followed the principles of nature and therefore placed a round stone fountain in the center of the square."
186,Raša,Trget,"Its name comes from the verb ‘trgetarenje' in Croatian (from the Latin word traiectum), which means ‘transport of people and goods from one side of the bay to the other'. There are ruins of the Romanesque church of St. Justin with a semicircular apse in the village center, and history books mention the existence of a medieval castle in Trget (Castello di San Giorgio). The village flourished at the end of the 19th century when a coal shipping harbor was built near-by. Numerous findings from the Antiquity were found in the hinterland of Trget. St. Marina The oldest settlement traces were found in the surroundings of today's Sv. Marina, including several Bronze Age hill forts and stone barrows. Appropriate strategic position, pleasant climate and fertile land caused Roman families to start settling here in the course of the 1st and 2nd century. One of the Roman objects was located on the southern part of the peninsula, on the spot where now stands the church of St. Marina. A Roman villa rustica was built there, and its ruins were still visible at the beginning of the 20th century. Next to the villa on an unknown location there was a small necropolis (a cemetery), whose remains were discovered at the beginning of the last century. Several glass fragments found in the surroundings and a part of a window transenna (stone grille) which was part of an earlier church building belong to Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. The church of St. Marina was reconstructed in the 12th/13th century, when there was a medieval cemetery in its yard. The church serves as a proof of a medieval settlement whose traces are still to be discovered. According to a local tradition, there was once a nunnery near the church. The Venetian government has left us with no traces of its rule in Sv. Marina. It is assumed that the place was inhabited at that time and there was a small port in the bay. Sv. Marina began to flourish in the early 19th century when the whole of Labin area thanks to mining started to develop more intensively. Bigger and modern houses, covered in roofing tiles were built in Sv. Marina, and its inhabitants got engaged in trading and maritime affairs. At the beginning of the 20th century there were a shop, a cafe and a small police office (in order to prevent smuggling at sea) in Sv. Marina. A primary school with lessons in Croatian, started by St. Cyril and Methodius association, was working from 1905-1919. After the war the village gradually started to die out, with part of its inhabitants leaving that time Yugoslavia or moving to larger cities, the school closed down, and the sailing boats were nationalized. The new revival took place in the early 1980s with the new industry-tourism. A camping site Marina was opened in 1981, with a capacity of 400 people, whereas now it can host 750 people. Sv. Marina today is all tourism-oriented, other than the camping site; there is also private accommodation available, cafes and restaurants, and a diving center within the camping site. Skitača Numerous Bronze Age archaeological sites are located in the surroundings of Skitača, such as Cuf, Bobrine and Brdo hill forts and Trdačina cave. In the course of the 16th century Skitača was settled by the Vlachs (known as the Istrian Romanians) which is documented and described in a work by a Romanian historian and travel writer Ion Maiorescu, who visited Skitača in the mid-19th century. Since 1632 Skitača is one of the parish centers of Labin area. The people from Skitača were traditionally engaged in livestock and to a lesser extend agriculture and maritime affairs. The center of the village is dominated by the church of St. Lucy and a former parish home and school building, nowadays turned into a mountaineering house. There is a cemetery next to the church. The church of St. Lucy was built in the early 17th century. The building got its present shape in 1924, when the construction of the bell tower begun, which remained unfinished until today. It is a one-nave Baroque church with an apse inside the church. The main marble altar is dedicated to St. Lucy, while the two wooden side altars are dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua and the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the last ten years the revitalization of Skitača begun thanks to ‘Skitaci' mountaineering association and the renovated mountaineering house. The hill Brdo is located approximately 30 min walk from Skitača center. Under the hill top on its north side there is a well, known as St. Lucy's well, after the saint patroness of Skitača. The well itself is a natural hollow in the limestone filled with water which almost never dries out. There are two legends associated with St. Lucy. According to the first, St. Lucy wandered around the world until she reached a rock at the end of Skitača village. As she was tired, she sat on the rock and fell asleep. When she woke up the next morning she noticed a fresh well near-by where she washed her face. Since then there is always some water in the well, and the Catholics and those with eye-sight problems believe that the water from the well cures eye and sight diseases. The other legend suggests that while St. Lucy was walking around the world one day she came on the top of hill Brdo at the end of Skitača village, and, when she saw the spectacular view over the Kvarner bay, she started crying out of grace. As her tears fell down on the ground, they formed a well."
186,Raša,Sacred art,"Church of St. Barbara Church of St. Barbara, the patron saint of miners is extremely valuable architectural work and a true example of modernist and rationalist conception of architecture with extraordinary profound light and shadow show and a skillful use of volume. In terms of design Pulitzer, as a German student, takes similar examples of churches that had been built in Germany. The cubic bell tower of a rectangular shape, attached to the church, certainly makes its contribution to the vertical views of the town with its twenty-five meter high tower. By the east entrance of the church there is a space associated with the church intended for the people, like a covered lopica (a portico) in Istrian medieval churches. Architecturally, it creates a counterbalance to the arcades on the southern part of the square and constructively regulates the ventilation in the square. Unfortunately, in the mid-1990s the covered part by the east entrance was framed with steel-glass construction. On the right entrance pylon of the church there is a stone relief of St. Barbara, made by famous Trieste- sculptor Ugo Carà. The church of St. Lucy The church of St. Lucy was built in the early 17th century. The building got its present shape in 1924, when the construction of the bell tower begun, which remained unfinished until today. It is a one-nave Baroque church with an apse inside the church. The main marble altar is dedicated to St. Lucy, while the two wooden side altars are dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua and the Blessed Virgin Mary. There is a cemetery next to the church. Church of St. John Five hundred meters facing south from the village of Brovinje right next to Holcim cement factory quarry there are a church and an abbey dedicated to St. John. The 14th century church of St. John is a one-nave Romanesque church with a semicircular apse. It was built of long narrow semi-worked thin squares, arranged in proper and equally thick layers. The entrance and the bell cote on the façade are of Gothic origin. The interior is decorated with early 15th century frescos. There is a cemetery next to the church, which was partially explored at the beginning of 1990s. Near the church there are ruins of St. John's abbey. An Early Bronze age hill fort hill and a medieval tower Turan, owned by the Battiala family, were once located on the near-by Gradac hill. Both were destroyed at the beginning of 1990s due to quarry expansion. St. Sebastijan The village of Škrokoni is located 4 km south of Labin on the road heading to Sv. Marina. A Romanesque church dedicated to St. Sebastian was built on the south edge of the village. The church is a part of a larger archaeological zone, with traces of settlement which date back to Antiquity and the medieval time. The church was built in the 12th/13th century using scrap stone arranged in equal layers. A constructive stone frame of the main entrance has got a typical Romanesque semicircular arch. The only window is set in the middle of the south wall. In the 18th century a Roman inscription was found in the church, with the name Labin being mentioned for the forst time- ‘res publica albonessium'.  The inscription is now stored in the museum in Labin. St. Lawrence The church dedicated to St. Lawrence is located at the entrance to the village of Sv. Lovreč Labinski (Diminići). It is a one-nave 17th century Baroque church with a semicircular presbytery. Two inscriptions on the façade made in 1653 provide exact construction and renovation dates. The main altar, made of stone with incrustation, dates back to the 17th century, and according to a local legend it was brought here from Dubašnica on the isle of Krk. The altar is made of marble, and includes a tabernacle and the altarpiece depicting Blessed Virgin Mary with a Child; St. Lawrence and St. Francis of Assisi. Parts of the former 17th century wooden altar were used and put onto the confessional, while the two wooden statues are still held behind the main altar. There is a cemetery next to the church. St. Matej The church of St. Matthew is located north from the Skitača village, in the groves of Prodol. It is situated next to the old village road heading from a hamlet village of Mihaljini to Skitača. Gothic one-nave rectangular building is covered with a cross-ribbed vault, the same being divided into two parts. Interior walls are decorated with frescos, which are severely damaged and the saints are hardly recognizable. Among the usual and popular saints, such as St. Michael, St. George and St. John the Baptist, there is one, wrapped as an infant. It is St. Lazarus from Bethany, a brother to Martha and Mary, who was restored to life four days after his death. As it now can be seen, the frescos are similar to the younger, Gothic fresco layer in St. Martin's church in Sv. Lovreč Pazenatički. This church was built in the 14th/15th century. It once belonged to the Scampicchio family. The church, completely renovated in 2012, is now registered as a cultural heritage of the Republic of Croatia"

187,Ravni Kotari,ASSERIA,"Tamo gdje pitoma ravnokotarska polja postaju kršne goleti Bukovice, na strarteškoj uzvisini nad važnim putevima stoji dugo koliko i vrijeme - Asseria, ondje gdje se pred 2.000 godina iz rimskog Jadera (Zadra) putovalo u tadašnju metropolu Salonu (Solin). Asserije je bila liburnski grad nastao u brončano i željezno doba, nadograđen u Rimskom carstvu, a koji je intenzivno živio od 5 stoljeća prije Krista do 6 stoljeća naše ere nakon čega je napušten. Najbližeselo selo zove se Podgrađe - jer je niklo „pod Gradom"". Istraživanja traju sustavno i obuhvaćaju grad površine oko 850 x 200 metara što je za ono vrijeme ogromno. Okružuju ga ogromni do 7 m visoki i 3 široki kameni zidovi od oko 2,5 km. Za prijevoz ovolike količine kamena danas bi trebalo 2.000 željezničkih vagona. Grad se nalazio na važnoj cesti koja je vodila od kolonije Jader (Zadar) prema unutrašnjosti i rimskim municipalnim središtima Nedinumu (Nadin), Varvariji (Bribir), odnosno dalje prema Scardoni (Skradin), vojnom logoru Burnumu (Ivoševci kod Kistanja) i dalje prema Saloni (Solin) glavnom gradu rimske provincije Dalmacije, na strateškoj rimskoj cesti Via Magni.Grad je to čudesnih kamenih nadgrobnih spomenika liburnskih cipusa, gordih vrata cara Trajana i monumentalnog žrtvenika s prikazom vučice s Romulom i Remom KAŠTEL BENKOVIĆ Benkovački kaštel stara hrvatska utvrda iz druge polovice 15. st., nazvana je po hrvatskim velikašima koji su je izgradili, vjerojatno u drugoj polovici 15. stoljeća. Izgradnjom ove utvrde na brežuljku koji dominira okolnim područjem počinje i povijest samog grada Benkovca. U svoj su ga dvorac-utvrdu pretvorili begovi nakon dolaska Turaka u 16. stoljeću, i oni imena Benkovići . Time su i gradu odredili ime. Četverokutni kaštel sa visokom kulom na sjeveru na jugu ojačan za turske vlasti dvjema okruglim kulama na uglovima. Danas je Muzej u čijem lapidariju se s libursnko-rimskih cipusa (cilindričnih nadgrobnih spomenika) iščitava dio antičke povijesti kraja. Iz obližnje Asserije je rijedak reljef u kamenu s prikazom Romula i Rea što sišu vučicu a ponos muzeje jedinstven je trocjevni top izrađen po nacrtu Leonarda da Vincia. U svom prostranom dvorištu u hladu divljeg kestena udomljuje mnoge manifestacije na čelu s kultnim Vinfestom kad okupi najbolje vinare Sjeverne Dalmacije uz mnoštvo gostiju."
187,Ravni Kotari,KLICEVICA FORTRESS,"Nad ponirućim potokom Kličevica, što mu ime daju kliktaji za najbujalih voda u sezoni kiša, u rajskom prirodnom okružju istoimena je srednjovjekovna utvrda koju sagradiše Krbavski knezovi 1454.god. Trapezasto kameno zdanje sa zidovima visokim prosječno 10 m sa kulom sačuvanom do visine od 16 m., s nekoliko otvora i strijelnica tek je jedna od najbolje sačuvanih fortifikacija iz srednjeg vijeka kojima Ravni kotari obiluju, a što potvrđuje njihovu nemirnu povijest na granicama država i carstava. Uz ostatke mlinica ovdje upećinama uz potok pronađeni su i ostaci Neandertalaca, a tu su dječaci igrajući se pronašli i čuveni ""da Vincijev"" trocjevni top. Potok se poslije utvrde, a prije nestajanja, slijeva ka Nadinskom blatu tvoreći nekadašnju močvaru a danas najveći plantažani nasad vinograda u Sjevernoj Dalmaciji kojem milenijske bujične naslaga hrane vina svjetske kvalitete mahom eko -organske proizvodnje. Uz utvrdu poviše potoka lijepo uređeno odmorište i vidikovac u sjeni borova pozivaju na piknik ili tek kratak predah. Ostaci tamplarskog grada i Maškovića han na Vrani U blizini Vranskog jezera ostaci su grada Vrane iz srednjeg vijeka. Spominje se već u 9. stoljeću. U Vrani je bio prvi benediktinski samostan, zatim su došli templari, a poslije njih ivanovci . Mistične priče o skrivenom blagu templara koji su odavde upravljali svojim posjedima na teritoriju cijel današnje Hrvatske i Mađarske, a preko obližnje luke u Pakoštanima plovili put Svete zemlje i Jeruzalema, traju do danas. Vrana je kao papinski posjed darovan im od kralja Dmitra Zvonimira, dakle bila prvo veleposlanstvo Vatikana, čuvala i insignije hrvatskih vladara - žezlo i dvije draguljima optočene krune, za kojima se i danas traga, a kojima su u nedalekom Biogradu na Moru krunjeni hrvatski vladari, do Kolomana Arpadovića kada ravnokotarskih 12 hrvatskih rodova odluči za kralja okruniti ugarskog vladara 1102. Politički moćni vranski priori određivali su nerijetko sudbinu kraljeva ( Ivan Paližna i Petar Berislavić). Ovdašnji dječak Jusuf Mašković uspeo se do admirala - zapovjednika flote moćnog Turskog carstva,a u rodnom je mjestu gradio han. Maškoviča han to je i danas kada je obnovljen i stavljen kao hotel sa restornaom ali i muzejem i bekrajnim pričama na usluzi putnicima namjernicima, sada turistima, Odavde su svojim djelom na put do pariškog Lovurea odnosno upisa Urbina na UNESCO-ov listu svjetske baštine krenuli i Franjo i Lucijan Vranjanin. . Crkvine pod Šopotom i prvi napis koji spominje Hrvate Crkvine pod Šopotom mjesto su na kojem je nađen Branimirov napis u kojem se prvi put spominje hrvatsko ime. Hrvaski knez Branimr ostavio je niz napisa u ovim prostorima a Branimirov natpis nađen nedaleko u Šopotu prvi je u kojem se spominje Hrvate. Branimir je knez koji je prvi od pape primio potvdu vladavine što je u tim vremenima odgovaralo međunarodnom priznanju Hrvatske. Janković Tower Znana i kao Kula Janković Stojana, prema najznačajnijem predstavniku slavne serdarske obitelji, jedinstven je povijesni spomen, spoj obrambenog, stambenog i gospodarskog objekta, branika na granici s nekadašnjim Otomanskim carstvom, koja budi epske asocijacije. Stojana Janković proslavio u borbama protiv Turaka u 17. st. i postao legendarni junak opjevan u više epskih narodnih pjesama, te od Mletačke Republike za svoje uspjehe u borbi dobio plemićku titulu Cavalierea. Nasljednik Jankovića pisac Vladan Desnica, čije je obitelji Kula i danas vlasništvo, ovdje je stvarao svoja najveća djela, a tu je i sahranjen u crkvi-obiteljskoj grobnici pored utvrde. Kotarski serdari proslavljeni i opjevani u junačkim narodnim pjesmama kao borci protiv Turaka bili su zapovjednici ovdašnjih uskoka odnosno domaćeg te naseljenog kršćanskog stanovništva dužni uvijek imati pod ratnom opremom i spremno za bitke određen broj vojnika na nemirnoj granici."
187,Ravni Kotari,Bike,"Vidjeti, slušati i dotaknuti prirodu, uživajući pritom u laganoj vožnji biciklom, ili osvojiti vrh, spustiti se s planine, izazivati tijelo po makadamskim putovima u podnožju, pratiti tok rijeke birajući različite biciklističke razine, izuzetno je zadovoljstvo. Svatko odvažniji, priključi li se, otkrit će novi svijet i slaviti okus vlastite pobjede. Raznolikost krajolika i terena omogućuje uvijek zanimljivu vožnju po označenim i održavanim ili zahtjevnijim stazama, sami ili u organiziranim turama i s vodičima. Uvjeti za biciklizam kao oblik aktivnog odmora u ovom kraju su upravo idealni. Ljubitelji biciklizma na raspolaganju imaju nekoliko biciklističkih staza s kojima imaju priliku upoznati karakteristične krajolike i morsko-planinske pejzaže u okruženju iznimno atraktivnih kulturno-povijesnih i prirodnih lokaliteta, te krenuti stazama koja vode kroz pitoreskna sela kojima dominira autentična ruralna arhitektura i stari običaji gdje ćete doživjeti istinski dašak prošlosti i tradicije. Netaknuta priroda, bogata flora i fauna te prekrasni pogledi na otoke i okolicu omogućit će vam uživanje u vožnji nezaboravnim stazama na kojim ćete vjerojatno susresti gostoljubivo lokalno stanovništvo koje njeguje tradicionalni način života te nudi autohtonu hranu i nadaleko poznata vina. Otkrijte i sami zašto su biciklističke staze Ravnih kotara iskustvo i doživljaj koji se pamti zauvijek.."
187,Ravni Kotari,Cannon by Leonardo da Vinci,"Old Croatian fortress Kličevica, dating from the 15th century, was guarded by the bronze triple-barrel cannon that was confirmed to be a construction of the famous Leonardo da Vinci himself and the world's only original of that kind. The cannon was discovered four decades ago and now it's finally confirmed that this five-century-old weapon was made by the great artist and scientist. Da Vinci's cannon had three barrels and for cooling it used water that would expand into vapour blasting the cannonball by its pressure. He claimed in his writings that in this way he even succeeded to blast the cannonball three thousand metres high up in the air. Leonardo da Vinci's cannon, together with all the writings from that time, attracts nowadays many curious visitors from all over the world. This unique discovery is definitely one of the reasons why you should visit the heritage Museum in Benkovac and become the witness of the famous inventor's genius."

187,Ravni Kotari,OILS OF THE RAVNI KOTARI,"Ulja Ravnih kotara SU ekstra djevičanska maslinova ulja, a što označava ulja pikantnijeg i gorčeg okusa, s minimalnim kiselinama, a što označava sačuvane temeljne zdrave tvari (polifenioli, antioksidansi,..) koje maslinovo ulje čine iznimno zdravim i u tom smislu i jednom od temelja Mediteranske prehrane upisane na Listi nematrijalne baštine čovječanstva UNESCO-a. Zdrave sastojke maslinovih ulja gotovo je nemoguće nabrojati, a tek neki su nezasićene masne kiseline , skvalen, karotenoidi (beta-karoten i ostali) i steroli, tj. fitosteroli, vitamini A, D, E i K, alfa-linolenska kiselina, oleuropein,... Poželjna svojstva kod ekstra djevičanskog ulja su: pikantnost, gorčina, okus i miris po plodu masline, slatkoća, miris svježe pokošene zelene trave ili miris lišća, rajčice, badema, artičoke, jabuke ili kivija... Izraženost tih okusa ovisi o vremenu berbe, sortama maslina, uvjetima čuvanja kao i kupažama - miksevima kojima se postiže uravnoteženost tih svojstava, iako je moguća, ovisno o ukusima, i uporaba jednosortnih ulja. Ulja izraženijih fenole dulje se čuvaju, a temeljna narodna izreka ipak kaže - Pij mlada ulja i stara vina! Konzumcija ekstra djevičanskih maslinovih ulja rezultira umanjenim rizikom od bolesti srca, prevencijom karcinoma te snaženjem imunološkog sustava, boljim radom mozga i antiupalnim svojstvima."

Danas će vam i u inačicama vrhnja i kravljeg sira, a sad često i šećera (kojeg u ona vremena nije bilo ""ni za lijek"", kako glasi pučka uzrečica) dočarati jednostavnu genijalnost rođenu u nuždi. Janjetina na ražnju Osam tisuća godina traje ""oda janjetini"" uz janjetinu sa ražnja na prostoru Ravnih kotara i Bukovice. To je jelo starije od carstva i sjećanja. Kad recept nije mijenjan od pramediteranaca i traje koliko i povijest, a stariji je od pismenosti, onda ga ljudi imaju u svojoj prirodi i s njime se slavi rađanje i život i smrt i ispračaj pokojnika."
187,Ravni Kotari,History,"The wider area of Bukovica and Ravni kotari is a rich source of testimony to life back to the Stone Age, over the extremely intensive Middle Age period, up to the present day. This is exactly the area where the Croatian hereditary peers settled, and the area itself is called Hrvati (Croats) in medieval documents. This is also the spot where an inscribed stone fragment was found with the name of the Croatian Duke Branimir, going back to the year 879, one of the oldest inscribed monuments of Croatian culture. The inscription on a gable is the oldest document mentioning the name Croat. There are numerous archaeological sites and findings, as well as historic monuments as a testimony to the rich history of the Croatian people, in an area where more than a thousand years ago the first Croatian state existed, where nature has playfully created a vast and rich country that, combined with its inhabitants, is creating ideal living conditions."

Modern guests want more, i. e. they want to get to know all the special things, the autochthonous and traditional values that one can not encounter very easily. Moreover, they want the true experience of the place they visit. The area of Ravni kotari is the initiator of the rural development and the leader in the preservation and promotion of the rich heritage and all the other values of the Dalmatian hinterland that must not be forgotten. It's hard to find the area with such an abundance, unique ethnic treasure and vivid traditions where nature had played and created vast and abundant soil with the perfect harmony of people and nature, harmony full of mutual appreciation and respect that has been present for centuries."

Mediteransku prehranu, kao najzdraviju na svijetu koja nije tek prehrana već i obred. Gradnje suhozida osim što su određivale međe posjeda, očuvavale su komade plodne zemlje nerijetko za vinograde. Ojkanje je arhaičan i danas očuvan grleni način pjevanja, pozdravljanja i pričanja, a Gluvo kolo govori i sada kako su se ljudi zabavljali kroz stoljeća bez čuda suvremene tehnike, kako se družilo, radovalo, zagledalo i ženilo u gotovo mkističnom ritmičkom plesu samo uz topot nogu. Gotovo svako selo ove doline im svoje folklorno i kulturno umjetničko društvo koje tradicije kao i nošnje njeguje.

187,Ravni Kotari,Ojkanje singing,"The oldest way of singing in Croatia. Like some distant voice coming from the early times, the traditional singing of vibrant voices , i.e. ojkanje, is one of the most distinguishing features of the inhabitants' traditional culture. The surprising voices,  performed by only one singer or accompanied by another, and the melodies that modify their harmony and intervals, will sound not only ancient but also fun. That's the reason why ojkanje was inscribed in 2010 on the UNESCO's List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding.

It blows more often during the winter months and can last for several days. The wind usualy starts to blow suddenly and in the evening the strongest gusts can be felt, while during the day it ""calms down"" waiting for the night to come. The speed during strong storms often exceed 72km/h, and the highest measured gusts of wind were recorded on Maslenica bridge in 1998, and they were 248 km/h. During the summer Bora comes as a welcomed refreshment because the wind blows significantly weaker than in the winter. Swimming in the high waves is especially interesting for tourists because the sea is warm, but when going out you sholud quickly cover yourself with a towel. Ražanac is one of the few settlements in the Velebit Channel facing north, directly exposed to the wind. People have lived in this area for thousands od years, and although Bora can be harmful to buildings, ships and vegetation, threaten land and sea traffic, in this region it is considered a favorable factor. When it blows, it brings clean mountain air, mixed with warmer sea air that refreshes the body and finely dispersed salt and iodine particles improve breathing."

189,Rijeka,Rijeka,"Rijeka is a city of rich history and dynamic present, new perspectives and the joy of life. Alongside its newly acquired benefits as a tourist centre that has escaped from its former image of a port and industrial city, it adds old ones as well -excellent connections by road, boat, rail or plane, both as a means of arrival and as a starting point for new journeys. In the historical image of the city, from prehistory and the Gothic, and then the baroque Rijeka and the strong influences of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, centuries have been deposited and each and every one of them has left its mark in its architecture, creating an interesting city nucleus rich in historical monuments. Trsat, a part of Rijeka, is a very special place for citizens of Rijeka and their guests, as the oldest Croatian Marian shrine and a destination for many religious people, including the Holy Father John Paul II. in 2003. Rijeka has a rich history yet is not its slave. Instead it pulsates with a dynamic rhythm of everyday life, which you can feel in the best way in the very centre of the city, on the always vibrant central promenade, Korzo. You sit and people, images and events are passing by... But even when the lights go out and many cities go silent, Rijeka lives intensely in cafes and restaurants with excellent gastronomic offers and, of course, in clubs where the party goes on until late at night for young people. Rijeka's calendar of events is overflowing throughout the year so regardless of the season, guests will find interesting and attractive music, drama, art ... performances, as well as urban clubs for the younger generations that offer their kind of entertainment. Together with the traditional but always interesting summer events program, manifestations such as Summer at Gradina (Ljeto na Gradini) and others will definitely occupy your attention as well. Visitors of all generations to the aforementioned events will enjoy a rich program of drama, music and art performances prepared by the most famous artists from Croatia and around the world. However, Rijeka lives intensely on its coast with its beautiful beaches. Exploring the city via planned walking routes or bicycle trails is also interesting. Rijeka, to put it simply, has many faces -all of them are interesting and seductive and all of them are meant for you. Culture & Heritage Dynamic history is written all over Rijeka and the Rijeka Ring in the numerous cultural and historical monuments, a tour of which is part of the route for every tourist who arrives in this city and region. Every generation will find entertainment to their liking and all of them will find cultural content that is an integral part of Croatian and world cultural heritage."
189,Rijeka,Astronomical Centre Rijeka,"It was opened in 2009 above the city, in the former fortress which dates back to the Second World War. In 2001 a telescope protected by a mobile dome was installed in one of the four fortress towers. Today it is the first astronomy centre in Croatia that includes both an observatory and a planetarium. It is also the only planetarium in Croatia and the wider region with digital technology. Its programme takes place within a spherical dome which can host up to 52 visitors. Here you can enjoy films and presentations dedicated to the immensity of the universe. The planetarium is part of the International Planetarium Society. The centre includes lecture halls and workshop areas, a bar and a terrace with a panoramic view over the Kvarner Bay. It is reachable by city bus, which is very rare when such facilities are concerned. The building is completely adapted for disabled persons. The Astronomical Centre Rijeka is the only facility of its kind in Croatia."
189,Rijeka,City Market,"It developed next to the sea shore, near the wooden pier, where the local fishermen used to unload their catch and take it in baskets to the market to sell. Fish, crabs and seashells were first sold in the open, but in 1866 a fish market was erected. In line with the project by Izidor Vauchnig, the director of Rijeka's Office for Architecture, the construction of two pavilions began in 1880, next to the fish market. That was how other vendors found themselves with a roof over their heads. All of the buildings were constructed on the sea area created by filling. The architect used the top solutions of his time by utilising steel grid-like construction and glass. He remained faithful to the previous, historical experiences in other construction elements by decorating the façades with reliefs depicting fruit and vegetables. The three buildings became the backbone of the new residential area. Nevertheless, the fish market became less and less hygienic in the face of a developing city, so a decision was made to build a new one. Carlo Pergoli, an architect from Rijeka, was assigned the job and the construction began prior to the WWI. In 1914, after the fish storage building was completed, the construction of the main building lasted until 1916. In his architectural shaping, Pergoli displayed his love for the Vienna secession. This can clearly be seen in the stone decorations, the work of Venetian sculptor Urban Bottasso. The work includes capitals, four fountains within the fish market, decorations and the façade. Bottasso placed around the pillars and on the façade a vast sea world with such skill, almost as if he was the one working as a fish vendor. Stone crabs, octopuses, fish and seashells have a lifelike effect, calling for passers-by to enter the fish market and find there something for their dining table. The main City Market has been the place chosen by the people of Rijeka as the best place to dine since the 19th century."
189,Rijeka,Ivan Kobler Square,"Located in the modern-day Ivan Kobler Square, there was once a more compact municipal centre called Placa, which served the significantly smaller fortified medieval town. The most knowledgeable historical interpretations of Rijeka Town present it as vertically elongated, framed to the north and south by the City Tower and the Town Hall, and to the east and west by chains of houses. The northern part of Rijeka was dominated by the Lord's castle, the eastern part featured the main commoners' church with a cemetery, to the west there was a spacious cloistered enclosure, and here, in the south quarter, near the embankment and the beach market under the town walls, there was the vibrant heart of the Town. There, the citizens of Rijeka would meet to listen to the proclamations of the Town Crier, seal contracts and buy and sell on the open market or in stores situated in the ground floors of houses. Only traces of those houses remain now, with several old walls integrated into more modern buildings, a baroque lintel with the former owner's coat of arms and an arched underground corn house. In the near past was the former town ""Green market"" where fruit and vegetables were sold. A narrow passage dividing the chain of houses on the east side of the Ivan Kobler Square is a remnant of a typically-proportioned medieval street. Bat Street was given its official name at the beginning of the 20th century because in the 2nd half of the 19th century, it was the headquarters of a local political party whose symbol was that small, flying mammal. The party's headquarters was marked by three stone reliefs of bats. One of them is still preserved today on the façade of a house in the remaining western end of this small street while the other is stored in the Rijeka City Museum. The oldest known of Rijeka's municipal palaces is also preserved at the northern end of Ivan Kobler Square. Rijeka's naturalised architect Antonio Verneda redesigned the palace in the baroque style of the late 18th century. Under the prevailing baroque forms, the remains of the medieval edifice are clearly visible. Like the many other important buildings of medieval Rijeka, the palace is situated at the intersection of two former main streets (Dekuman and Kardo), which follow the earlier urban street layout of antiquity. Council meetings were held in that building right up until 1838. After that, the Town administration transferred to facilities in the Augustinian monastery situated in the western part of Rijeka's Old Town. On the occasion of the 150th anniversary of Rijeka's Paper Factory, the oldest in this part of Europe, a fountain was built in 1974 at Ivan Kobler Square based upon a design by Rijeka architect Igor Emili using paper press equipment (tijesak) made in the factory. Passing under the round City Tower, the former main medieval town entrance that gave access to the coast, you enter the centre of Rijeka's Old Town."
189,Rijeka,Korzo,"Anyone who, at least once, had a coffee at one of the terraces of numerous and picturesque cafe bars lined along this unusual promenade, would agree. Anyone who was at least once sitting on one of the benches placed at Korzo, precisely for this purpose, as well as-those who were looking at the most picturesque city's street from the ""top"" of some of the most popular meeting places of Rijeka's citizens, located at the top floors of buildings. Rijeka's citizens are loyal to Korzo in both their winter coats and fluttering summer dresses. They equally visit it under umbrellas and when blown by the bora, a wind that is, just like Korzo, a specific feature of this town built along the riverbanks, oriented towards the sea for centuries. They are here to repel the autumn sorrow and to be the harbingers of spring. Inextricable are the threads connecting Rijeka's ""number 1 street"" and its citizens. Korzo is the place where people gather and move apart, where they hang out, do business, make acquaintances, but also go shopping. The citizens of Rijeka can do whatever they want at Korzo. They can see and be seen. Some would say that Korzo is the place where the live city newspapers are written daily. They are both written and read by the citizens themselves, but also by all those who come to Rijeka from all over the world. Oh, you can't even imagine how Korzo likes to show off in front of them... It swaggers in the full splendour of its facades on which the rich and turbulent history of Rijeka is written. It struts its fountains, its city clock that like a centuries old guardian watches over this promenade. Korzo also attracts with a rich offer of its souvenir shops, offering ""morčić"" and ""torpedo"" as something that belongs only to it, something that will whisper to every traveller even in a hundred years - I am from Rijeka, I am a brand of the city on Rječina. Korzo is the place where you can hear the typical rhythm of Rijeka's steps which, regardless of the time of day, echo through this main Rijeka's street.  Thousands of sounds are merging here. And the smells... That of the morning coffee, delicious pizza or seafood coming from some of the numerous restaurants located close to Korzo. And the evening smell, imbued with a ""youthful touch"", the touch of going out and having a good time. Because an evening or a night at Korzo are synonyms for entertainment. It is the time when cafe bars become clubs, and laugh and music is what dominates Korzo. And while the neighbourhoods at the edge of the city are in deep sleep, Korzo does not need sleep. Every part of it lives its life to the fullest, and has been doing so for centuries. As early as at the beginning of the 20th century Korzo started to assume its modern-day outlines. The main promenade and the meeting point for Rijeka's citizens, as well as the area for erecting the symbolic palaces representing various styles including the Classical, Historical, Secessional, Modernist... The urban regulation, taking place in the mid-19th century, was only a prelude to a growing pace of reclamation and major public constructions which would soon ensue on the made up ground. However, already at that point the centuries old image of a littoral town straitened by its walls started to fade away. Today, it is hard to believe that until the moat was filled and the city walls pulled down, in the second half of the 18th century, this was only gravel seashore with a few wooden quays and storehouses, a shipyard and the city lodge next to which cereals, fish and salt were traded. Rijeka is reflected in Korzo, at Korzo you can read Rijeka."
189,Rijeka,Korzo through history,"St. Vitus' Cathedral The construction of this church, designed by the Jesuit architect G. Briano, began in 1638. It was made on the model of the famous Venetian church of Santa Maria della Salute. The location selected for the construction of the St. Vitus' church was an elevated area at the heart of the then still medieval urban tissue. Initially, there was a small church of the same name, dedicated to the city's patron saint. The Jesuits, as the creators of the project, primarily decided to use the cult of the Miraculous Crucifix from the small church, which, according to popular legend, started bleeding when a certain Petar Lončarić threw a stone at it after exploding with rage over a gambling loss. The early Gothic crucifix is incorporated into the Baroque main altar of the new church, which, in the spirit of storytelling piety inherent to miraculous relics, also houses Lončarić's stone and a small bronze hand. The investment in building a new St. Vitus' church exceeded the capacities of the local community; thus, with interruptions, it took a whole century to build it, and judging by the facade surfaces that are not covered in stone slabs, it has never been completed. The design underwent a substantial change in 1725, when the new constructor, B. Martinuzzi, added a gallery to the church. A local legend explains that this happened because the Jesuits did not want the monastic novitiate to mix with the masses during the mixed liturgy, especially with the beautiful girls of Rijeka. Inside, the church is a true baroque ""Gesamtkunstwerk"", a synthesis of the arts. The authors of the lush, luxurious Baroque works of the interior, the altar and the pulpit are masters who arrived from Gorizia and Friuli: S. Petruzzi, P. Lazzarini, L. Pacassi and A. Michelazzi, of which the latter became naturalized in Rijeka. The author of the altarpiece St. Joseph with the Child Jesus is a Ljubljana painter originally from Lotarignia, V. Metzinger. An unknown Baroque master painted the reredo of St. Ignazio Loyola. The only elements from the 19th century are Benevenuti's statue of Our Lady of Sorrows on the altar bearing the same name and Simonetti's painting of the Assumption of Mary. The church was consecrated in 1742 and is only a remnant of an ensemble that included the buildings of the Jesuit seminary and college, destroyed between the two world wars. The portal of the Jesuit college was preserved because it was relocated to the clergymen's house, which was built adjacent to the back wall of the St. Vitus' church. Next to the main entrance of the St. Vitus' church, the people of Rijeka embedded a cannonball with a humorous inscription in Latin, which in translation reads as follows: ""This fruit was sent to us by England when it wanted to oust the Gauls from here."" The inscription refers to a Napoleonic Wars episode that took place in Rijeka in 1813. As the inscription is a chronogram, you will see this year by reading the capital letters as Roman numerals. The St. Vitus church became a cathedral between the two world wars. By appointment, you can see a collection of paintings, goldsmiths' works, mass vestments, rare books, prints and other religious works of art that are displayed in the gallery of the cathedral. Be sure to visit it since you will also find a portrait of St. Francis Xavier, the patron saint of tourists. St. Vitus' Cathedral is the only Baroque rotunda of monumental proportions built on Croatian soil."
189,Rijeka,Trsat Castle,"At this same site there was a Liburnian observation post from prehistoric times, used for monitoring the roads leading from the hinterland to the coast. This location served well to the Romans to establish their defence system, the so-called Liburnian limes, whose starting point was the Tarsatica fortress town - which was situated at the site of today's Old City of Rijeka. The plateau of the Trsat Castle offers a magnificent view of the ruins of these limes situated on opposite hills, Katarina and Kalvarija, as well as of the whole area of the Rijeka's Old City. The Trsat Castle is one of the oldest fortifications on the Croatian coast which preserves the features of the early medieval town construction. Today the Trsat Castle has been enriched by new facilities and events - visual arts gallery, open-air summer concerts and theatre performances as well as fashion shows and literary evenings. Within the Trsat Castle, at the address Partizanski put 9A, you'll find the Trsat Castle Info Point where you can get any information about this building and the City of Rijeka. The tickets for the permanent exhibition can be bought at the Info point or on our web shop. every day from 9 am to midnight The Trsat Castle represents a strategically embossed lookout on a hill 138 meters above sea level dominating Rijeka. It was mentioned as a parochial centre for the first time in 1288. WORKING HOURS: Active holidays, outdoors & nature You take a special joy in sailing, diving or windsurfing?

189,Rijeka,Religious events,"Whether it is because of the sea that seafarers from far countries were bringing news to the city, or whether Rijeka has an open mind or something else is really not important. Everyone in this city feels welcomed. Here everybody feels at home, whilst the guests are welcomed with the open heart and with no prejudices. Tolerance and multiculturalism are built for generations. To love what is yours and to respect what is others'. Beneficial to that is a broad list of religious institutions that found their home in Rijeka, enriching the city with their presence. One morning back in 1291 Trsat's woodmen saw a small house in front of them in the woods that was not there earlier. Scared and surprised, they notified the vicar Jurjević about the miracle, and he calmed them down by telling them that he already knew what it was. In fact, it was the Nazareth house of the Holy Virgin Mary which was, from fear of the Ottoman conqueror, transported by angels to Trsat where it remained for full three years and seven months. However, after that period the moment arrived when the house continued its journey towards Lorreto, where it should have been transported to in the first place. Prince Martin Frankopan, in order to comfort the people of Trsat, built the Franciscan monastery on the same site. Today, the Our Lady's sanctuary known by many who have come here on pilgrimages and by the numerous believers, especially on the day of Assumption of Mary is located on Trsat. Date: 15th August Rijeka is a city that can also be branded as a city of diversities. Because it's been like that since forever."

189,Rijeka,Rijeka and surroundings,"Do you remember... ... your first summer vacation? Your first jump in the sea? Your first kiss? Do you...remember the feeling of carelessness? Pride? The tingles of excitement that marked them? Memories lead us to an untouchable and protected world.

190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Starigrad-Paklenica,"The Paklenica Riviera delights in its unbelievable mixture of varied landscapes, which in an instant can change before the eyes of the observer. Rocky shoes adorned with romantic bays suddenly turn into a luxurious pebble beach. The shining blue sea in a moment is exchanged for green forests and mountain peaks. Only a few minutes' walk from the center, old villages are still defying time, their stone walls preserving traces of the past. The thousand years of the rapidly flowing streams of the Velika and Mala Paklenica canyons, with their sources high up in the Velebit Mountain, formed at their base the fertile plain and peaceful shore that is the site of the present towns of Starigrad, Seline, and Tribanj. Starigrad, the center of the Paklenica Riviera, arose on the foundations of the ancient Roman city of Argyruntum. Today it is a lively tourist center with somewhat more than one thousand inhabitants, who exchanged their traditional manner of life in the foothills of the Velebit for life alongside the sea some half a century ago. The nearness and the easy access to the mountains, particularly through the attractive Velika Paklenica canyon, means that Starigrad is not merely a pleasant seaside resort, but also a traditional gathering place for hikers and climbers, adventurers and scientists, and all nature lovers who come to enjoy the beauties of Paklenica and the Velebit. While you are enjoying the crystal clear sea, your glance may come to rest on the magnificent canyons of Velika and Mala Paklenica, deeply cut into the Velebit Mountain above you, and you may not realize that they are responsible for the surprising richness of the natural pebble beaches on the Paklenica Riviera. But even those romantic souls who want hidden, rocky coves will come into their own, as they are abundant in the northwestern part of the Riviera."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Cycling,"Lovers of movement on two wheels can visit the attractions of the wider area on a bike. Aside from the area of the National Park Paklenica, which is after all a hiking paradise, the nearby area has 40 kilometres of sloping bike trails leading through a distinctive landscape of sea and mountains, touching attractive historical and natural sites. It is also possible to head by bike to the islands of the Zadar archipelago, taking the old road over Velebit or to Lake Vrana Nature Park..."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Eductional path STARIGRAD,"Artistic images of the Starigrad mirila (a resting spot for the body during the funeral procession from distant mountain villages to the grave - the mirila was built specifically for the deceased and once built, it was said that his mirila had been made; mirila = measure in the Dalmatian dialect), despite their rustic quality, the wealth of the raised engraving etched into the head stones is fascinating. At the first site along this trail, which can be reached from the road from the centre of Starigrad, is one of the rarely preserved headstones with an engraved anthropomorphic (human-like) symbol. From here, the mountain trail leads to the site Opuvani dolac, offer a magnificent view over Starigrad along the route. It is the iconography of the mirila that makes them so distinctive, and here, it is possible to see many different symbols - from the simple motif of the cross (Latin, Greek, solar, anthropomorphic), often in combination with solar circles, to fully undefined symbols (rosettes, spirals, four-hooks), whose meaning is known only to the master who engraved them... The return trip to Starigrad leads along a skilfully built trail down the steep slopes of Veliki Vitrenik. At the end of the trail, we recommend a visit to the small ethnography museum in the village of Marasovići to become better acquainted with the traditions, customs and culture of the Velebit region. Educational path LJUBOTIĆ The path includes 6 localities with mirila in the immediate vicinity of the village of Ljubotić, the former hub of this part of Velebit, to which the population of all the surrounding hamlets gravitated. This is also the location of the local cemetery - the starting place for the processions that carried the deceased to burial. Each of these localities contributes to a part of the story of this unique custom through words and pictures. The largest preserved group of over 300 mirila is the so-called Vukićeva mirila (6), located along an old path that connected the hamlet of Bristovac with Ljubotić. From the elevation on which the so-called Renjevačka mirila are located (5), there is a beautiful view of the entire Velebit Channel, all the way to the Zadar Archipelago. On the return trip, there is an opportunity to rest at the village household of Vrata Velebita, visit an ethno-house and a permanent exhibit on the development of beekeeping in Dalmatia and the Mediterranean. With advance notice, it is also possible to savor domestic specialties. Rafting/Canoeing Below the southern slopes of Velebit, carved deeply into the canyon of a very impassable region, flows the Zrmanja River. The river delights with its crystal clear waters winding through an imposing, 200 metre deep canyon, that ends its course mixing with the waters of the sea off the shores of the town of Novigrad. The upper reaches of the river abound in travertine waterfalls, among which the most attractive is the 11 metre high Veliki buk, while Jankovića buk, adorned with the imposing remains of old mills, is a favourite excursion area. This area is great for rafting and canouing excursions. When the water levels are lower in the summer months, there are organised kayak and canoe expeditions."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Speleology,"Get a glimpse the subterranean world of Velebit! A karst area, Mt. Velebit has an abundance of caves, and expert guides are available to take you on a speleological adventure.

190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Climbing and hiking in the National Park Paklenica,"Hiking is the only way to truly get to know NP Paklenica, whose primeval beech forests are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The National Park Paklenica contains over 150 km of trails and paths, from those characterized as tourist trails - leading from Velika Paklenica canyon to Manita peć cave, Lugarnica foresters house and Paklenica Mountain hut, to those characterized as hiking trails - leading to the highest peaks of the Velebit Mountain - Vaganski vrh (1752 m a.s.l.) and Sveto brdo (1753 m a.s.l.). The majestic canyons of Velika and Mala Paklenica are, according to many, the most impressive parts of the Park. There are about 500 well - equipped marked routes of different difficulty and length here (from grade 3 to 8b+), set in the carbonate rocks, so each climber can find something to his/her liking. No wonder that the International Climbers Meeting that gathers climbers from across the globe takes place here each year to take part in exciting events and competitions.

190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Pilgrimage on the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,"At Veliko Rujno, the largest plateau on Velebit, at 900 metres above sea level overlooking Starigrad-Paklenica, we find the ruins of the old and the new Church of the Mother of God. In the past, the local inhabitants lived predominantly from cattle breeding, and spent most of the year in distant Velebit hamlets taking their cattle out to graze. This is why this small church was built so high in the mountains. Over time, the church became too small for all of the people of the Starigrad area. In 1930, thanks to the dedication of the Starigrad priest and alpinist Don Ante Adžija, the people built a new church right next to it, using all of the masonry of the old church. And although the way of life in this region has changed, as the inhabitants moved to the coast in the 1960s and dedicated their efforts to tourism, the tradition of making a pilgrimage to the Church of the Mother of God on the Feast of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, every August 15th remains. And so, every year, a large number of pilgrims make their way up the mountain trail to Veliko Rujno, where a magnificent procession is held after a festive holy mass in the Church of the Mother of God."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Summer on the natural pebble beaches of Paklenica Riviera,"While you are enjoying the crystal clear sea, your glance may come to rest on the magnificent canyons of Velika and Mala Paklenica, deeply cut into the Velebit Mountain, responsible for the richness of the natural pebble beaches on the Paklenica Riviera. Pisak, Večka Tower and Jaz are beautiful pebbled beaches located on the coast of the Starigrad Paklenica riviera. They were created by the accumulation of many centuries of riverwash through the canyons of Velika and Mala Paklenica. These beaches are ideal for spending an active holiday on riviera Paklenica.

190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Following the footsteps of Winnetou,"The Winnetou films, originating in a coproduction of Rialto Film from Berlin and Jadran Film from Zagreb, are considered as the most popular films of all time in Germany. Among many potential locations worldwide, numerous Croatian areas were finally chosen for the filming: National Park Paklenica, National Park Plitvicka jezera, National Park Krka, the canyon of River Zrmanja, Nature Park Velebit(Tulove grede ridge, Prezid pass), Nature Park Vransko jezero, sites Modric, Rovanjska, Jasenice, Rastevic, Omis, then river Cetina, Grobnicko polje, Platak and others. As many as 7 out of 11 Winnetou films were shot close to Starigrad-Paklenica which subsequently became a favourite destination of fans of Karl May''s novels and Winnetou films, and the beautiful filming locations are perfectly preserved in all their glory. Some of the most beautiful natural areas in Croatia were selected as filming locations for Karl May's novels. Both national and nature parks were used, and touring them is an unforgettable experience. Strolling along the mountain paths of Paklenica, going on photo safari on the slopes of Velebit, cruising down the emerald-green river Zrmanja, taking in the breathtaking view from Parizevacka glavica, enjoying the exuberant beauty of Plitvica lakes, and revelling in the romantic Krka waterfalls - this is all just a part of the experience awaiting you during your tour of the Winnetou film locations in Croatia.

Organized tours of film locations are available as a part of organized tours from Starigrad-Paklenica, such as a river cruise on Zrmanja or a Photo Safari on Velebit. Traveling along the Winnetou trail wouldn't be complete without a visit to the Winnetou commemoration site in Starigrad - Paklenica with its permanent film exhibit. The exhibit is set up in an authentic spirit of the original space of Bluesun hotel Alan in Starigrad-Paklenica (Motel Paklenica). This space was used by the film crew during filming, and it's possible to see, along with many film props, photographs and other documentary materials, original rooms from that time."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Culture and Heritage,"Argyruntum soon became an important market town. Several stone inscriptions, found in what is today St. George's Street, speak about its early history. According to one of them, in mid-first century A.D., Roman emperor Tiberius provided the town with defensive walls and towers. At that time Argyruntum was probably elevated to municipal status, which meant that its inhabitants attained Roman citizenship. At the beginning of the 20th century, archaeologists Abramić and Colnago discovered the remains of Roman town walls underneath modern Starigrad. A regular grid of streets probably existed within the town walls. Beyond the walls, along the main road leading towards the southeast, stretched the town cemetery. The archaeologists excavated some 400 burials of Argyruntum's cemetery. As was the custom throughout the Roman Empire, people cremated their dead and deposited their ashes in urns made of glass, ceramic or stone. Various objects were put in graves next to the urns. Those objects testify of prosperity and refined tastes of the town dwellers, as well as of trade relations with distant corners of the Empire. Outstanding finds include jewelry made of silver, bronze and amber, oil lamps, tools and weapons, and vessels made of pottery, glass and metal. Rich finds from Argyruntum's cemetery indicate that, during Roman Imperial times, today's Starigrad-Paklenica fully enjoyed the splendors of Classical civilization. Of particular interest is the collection of glass vessels, which contains 146 vessels of various shapes. Some of them were imported from Egypt, Syria, Cyprus, Italy, Pannonia, and the Rhine regions of Gaul, while others were made in local workshops. The collection of Roman glass from Argyruntum is housed at the Museum of Ancient Glass in Zadar (Muzej antičkog stakla). Ethno house ""Marasović"" In authentic atmosphere of this stone house you will find traditional food of the area and permanent exhibition Mirila - unique custom from the past, today protected intangible cultural heritage of the Republic of Croatia."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Mirila,"Mirila preserve the memories of persons who died on the mountain slopes and had to be carried to the village church and then to the cemetery where they were buried. Mirila, stone monuments to the departed, can be found along the mountain paths, passes, elevations and clearings of the Velebit Mountain. Mirila date from the times of the Velebit hamlets (17th-20th centuries), that mainly survived from animal husbandry. On such arduous journeys, it was only permitted to stop, rest and place the deceased on the ground in one place - the place where the deceased would greet the sun for the last time.On this place was erected a mirilo, the resting place of the deceased. Flat stone tablets were generally laid at the head and foot of the deceased, marking his height, to be connected at a later date by a row of stone tablets. The headstones were also sometimes subsequently adorned with symbols carved in shallow relief. These mirila were venerated and visited more than graves, as it was believed that the grave only contained ""the body without the soul, which remained at the mirilo.""Mystical artistic markings on the headstones, among which the cross and solar circle were the most common, bear witness to a continuity of artistic adornment from prehistoric cultures, via early Christianity and the iconography of the stećak (medieval Bosnian standing tombstone), while inscriptions are rare and belong to more recent times. As the stone markers of a unique funeral cult, mirila convey the customs, way of life and creativity of an entire era. Educational paths will lead you to this stone monuments through the amazing nature of this area. St. Peter's Church The church was constructed in the pre-Romanesque Early Croatian style, most likely during the turn of the 10th century. This medieval church is located on the Adriatic highway between Starigrad and Seline. In the vicinity of the church, there is a graveyard with burial sites dating back to the mid 13th century. There are preserved, distinct gravestones in the shape of massive rock slabs decorated with simple, shallow relief depictions, dating back to the 14th - 16th centuries. There is a small structure next to the church, believed to have been used as a baptistery. ""Gathered from the fragments, it is clear that the church was constructed by a philanthropist as a votive gift, as is the case with the construction of churches and chapels in the Early Croatian times"" - Rukavina, A.: Zvona ispod zvijezda (Bell under the stars), Ličke župe (Lika parish), Gospić, 1984. In recent years, archaeological research has been conducted at the church and now it is fully recovered. The Velebit`s story about water Before the construction of waterworks, potable water was scarce in the villages of Velebit's maritime slope. Rare springs are located in higher mountain reaches, while permanent watercourses are virtually nonexistent due to the permeability of the karstic terrane. Violent storms can produce raging torrents, but they will flow for just a few hours. Ample quantity of rain falls from autumn to spring, but there is a long draught in summer. Rainwater therefore had to be captured before it disappeared in karstic underground, and stored for the dry season. Wells and cisterns were built for storage of the precious water. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Austro- Hungarian authorities strived to improve water supply in Dalmatia by building large cisterns. Public cisterns in Starigrad-Paklenica, Seline, and Tribanj were built at that time. They were constructed in modest neoclassical style, characterized by simple, plain shapes, flanked by stone basins for laundry and watering animals. Many households, especially those in hamlets high up the mountain, did not have their own cisterns, so they had to struggle in various ways in order to obtain the precious potable water. People obtained water using natural sources called kamenice, ledenice, čatrnje, lokve, špilje, vrulje... More about cultural and historical heritage that speaks of millennia of human existence on the slopes of Velebit despite harsh living conditions and scarcity of water brings „The Velebit`s story about water"". The tourist map „The Velebit`s story about water"" is availible in tourist information centers Starigrad, Seline and Tribanj."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Seline,"The village of Seline, a place of preserved simplicity, is located on an extensive plain, between the beautiful pebble beach and the enchanting canyon of Mala Paklenica. It is connected to Starigrad with walkways and a pedestrian-bicycle path through picturesque hamlets in the hilly hinterland."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Tribanj,"Tribanj-Kruščica, Šibuljine, and Sv. Marija Magdalena are miniature settlements stringed like jewels along the deep bays of the northwestern part of the Paklenica Riviera. Distant some ten kilometers from Starigrad, these are ideal places for a restful family holiday in a natural environment. From the center of Kruščica, a mountain road leads to Ljubotić - an idyllic Velebit hamlet where the traditional way of life has been preserved."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Caves,"„...we may well say that the underground of Paklenica is just as beautiful, or even more beautiful than its forest and steep cliffs above the ground."" (Josip Poljak 1929.) So far, 90 speleological objects have been explored in the NP Paklenica. In some of them were found 30.000-year old cave bear's (Ursus spelaeus) skull and also the fragments of ceramics and bones which indicates a temporary stay of people back int he Copper Age and Bronze Age (3.000-1.000 BC). Some of the deepest pits in Croatia are settled in the NP Paklenica, more then 500m deep. The local people had been using the caves as shelters up to couple of decades, so we can still find supporting masonry and outbuidings on the entrances of some caves. These are mostly small facilities that were use din the past by the local inhabitants as shelters for cattle and other goods. The specific form of speleological object are ice caves and pits where ice or snow stay almost the entire year round and they are located on the peaks oft he Velebit. Particular ice caves are used as a source of drinking water during the summer grazing season. The underground fauna is particularly rich and diverse and it has many endemic species, like endemic spider (Histopona egonpretneri), subterranean freshwater amphipod (Bogidiella sketi), cave beetle (Astagobius angustatus vukusici) and others."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Flora and fauna,"In addition to an exceptional geomorphology and relief that is immediately noticed by the visitors, Velebit and Paklenica also have an rich and diverse flora. Particularly valuable are forest communities of black pine (Pinus nigra) that are one of the largest on the Mediterranean. According to the latest inventarisation of flora, Paklenica is inhabited by more then a 1.000 of different species that represent an exceptional wealth on the small area of 95 km2 which is the area of the Park itself. The combination of Mediterranean, continental and alpine climates and the fact that Nature Park Velebit stretches from 10 to 1.757 m above sea level have led to the emergence of microclimatic localities, appropriate for the growth of many endemic plants, even 79 species. Some of them are: Sandwort (Arenaria orbicularis), Adriatic Bellflower (Campanula fenestrellata), meadow saffron (Crocus malyi), Velebit degenia (Degenija velebitica), Croatian Sand Rock-Cress (Sibiraea altaiensis ssp. Croatica), Kitaibel/s primrose (Primula kitaibeliana),... Equally valuable is the animal world with 1.500 species int he National Park Paklenica that have been known up to now. Birds are probably the most interesting part of Paklenica`s fauna. So far, 236 bird species have been recorded out of which 156 species reside within the Park limits (95 km2). Some have been very rare, birds of prey in particular, like the Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), the Short-toed Eagle (Circaetus gallicus),the Goshwak (Accipiter gentilis), the Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), the Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus),... Among 50 or so registered species, the most diverse are bats with 16 species and there is a significant number of Fat Dormouses and Eurasian Red Squirrels. Velebit is home of many endagered speacies, like the wolf, lynx and otter. The brown bear (Ursus arctors) is the largest land carnivore that resides here, although, it satisfies 95 % of its dietary needs with plant foods. Walking through Paklenica you will notice beautiful butterflies, especially in the spring. The most invertebrates are surely the diurnal butterflies that inhabit the blossoming meadows and edges of forests, their various colours have always raised visitor`s attention. Among the numerous species we can single out the Southern Festoon (Zerynthia polyxena), the Scarce Swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius) and the Swallowtail (Papilio machaon)."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Nature park Velebit,"The Paklenica Riviera is part of the Velebit Nature Park, which because of its specific relief, vegetative, and landscape features was placed by UNESCO in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves (the ""Man and the Biosphere"" Program from 1978). Velebit is the largest Croatian mountain range (2274 km2), deeply interwoven into the space, lives and consciousness of the locals. Due to the impressive beauty of the landscape, the variety of relief shapes, flora and fauna as well as the untouched nature, it was declared a Nature Park. Numerous hiking trails, historical buildings, old regal trails, fortresses and sacred monuments are evidence of man's centuries long relationship with this mythical mountain range. There are even 2 National Parks inside of this Nature Park: North Velebit and Paklenica."
190,Starigrad-Paklenica,Paklenica National Park,"Paklenica National Park is one of the best-known climbing destinations in Europe.

From Zadar, it is only a one hour drive to Starigrad-Paklenica. https://liburnija-zadar.hr/en/home/ Večka kula Tower Located at the edge of Večko polje(field), Večka kula(tower) was built by Venetians in 16th century as a part a fortification system that protected Podvelebitski Channel from the Turks. Presumably the tower was attached to the village of Veče (Veche), which was located in the area of modern Seline and was first mentioned by written sources in year 1508. The Romanesque church of St. Peter's probably belonged to the same village. Aside from the historic information, no trace of the village survives today. Many legends have been told about Večka Tower. The best-known among them is the legend of King Pasoglav (""Doghead"") that says... Once upon a time there was a king who had a human body and a dog's head. Every day a different young man would come to shave him, after which the king would have him killed in order to keep his secret. Hoping to save the life of her only son, a mother thought out a scheme. When his turn came to go and shave the king, she made a bred with her own milk and gave it to her son to offer it to the king. After the king had eaten the bread, the young man told him why it was so tasty. Since now they had become brothers in milk, the king decided to let the young man go, under the condition that he would not betray the secret about his dog's head. The young man kept the secret for a long time, but sooner or later he was bound to betray it. So he decided to tell the secret to the black earth. He dug a hole and whispered: ""O black earth, our king has a dog's head"". Chance would have it that an elder would grow at that spot, and a shepherd would make a flute from it. When the shepherd attempted to play the flute, words came out of it instead, saying: ""Our king has a dog's head!"" The secret became public all across the kingdom. The king was doomed to spend the rest of his life alone and unshaven, while young men no longer feared death at his tower."

191,Rogoznica,Settlements,"A guide to top 10 must-visit attractions in Rogoznica 1. Dragon's Eye The most famous natural attraction in Rogoznica is definitely Dragon's Eye, a lake so unique that its beauty is mesmerizing to visitors. Over the centuries, it has happened that the lake ""boils"", so this unusual phenomenon inspired locals to invent different legends about Dragon's Eye. 2. Cape Planka This is the most outstretched part of the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, and it's a geographical and climate divider of the north and south Adriatic. Its moody weather creates a stunning natural spectacle that attracts numerous weather and meteorology enthusiasts, photographers and anyone that loves watching the crashing of the giant waves. 3. Mulo lighthouse You can see this beautiful lighthouse even from the mainland, but for a real experience jump on a boat and visit this attraction up close. You can disembark the boat and even go for a walk around the lighthouse. Mulo lighthouse was built in the 1800's and although it is automatized today, its beauty still attracts a lot of visitors. 4. Marina Frapa Royalty among the Adriatic marinas, and certainly one of the most beautiful marinas in all of the Mediterranean. With the recognition Blue Flag marina Frapa confirms the commitment and respect for the environment and conservation of natural harmony. 5. Votive Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Chapel According to legend, in 1722 a fisherman named John Bogavčić-Tuburko, working in the area of the Cape Gradina, saw a strange light. When he approached the rock from which the light was emanating, he found a picture of Our Lady resting on it, a depiction of Mary visiting her cousin Elizabeth. He took the picture home and stored it in a trunk, but it mysteriously returned to the same place on the rock. This repeated three times. Soon the villagers and their priest decided to build a chapel on the site. 6. The lavender labyrinth One of the newer attractions in Rogoznica is the lavender labyrinth, located on top of Kopara, in old part of Rogoznica. The labyrinth is about 40 meters in diameter, with two trails at your disposal. The shorter trail is approximately 600 meters long, and the longer trail is about 1.2 kilometers long. This is an inhalation path, and an ideal place to just walk and enjoy the fresh air. 7. Church of St. John of Trogir This small church is located on Cape Planka, in a rugged desert landscape, and it's a protected site of national religious heritage. Solid in shape, its thick walls were built on whenever it was possible. Though the church is more than 10 meters from the sea, waves carrying destructive salt still manage to reach it. Over time, they've encircled the church with jagged rocks that now form part of the overall structure. 8. Church of the Assumption The parish of Rogoznica is special in many ways. It houses the only small cathedral built in Dalmatia wider than it is long and it's rich with valuable works of art. 9. Museum in the sea The waters around Rogoznica contain many shipwrecks from different historical periods, so we might say there is a museum in the deep blue sea, a trove of historical material intriguing scholars and tourists alike. 10. ""Obadva"" monument in Zečevo One of the most known scenes from Croatian War of Independence happened in Zečevo when Croatian defender Filip Gaćina yelled out ""Obadva, obadva, oba su pala"", meaning that both of the Serbian warplanes crashed. This moment was recorded on camera by Ivica Bilan, and the recording became iconic."

We cherish and appreciate nature and our visitors remain breathless at the enchanting scenery hidden in picturesque places and hidden beaches before the magnificent cliffs and lush vegetation! With a length of up to 50 kilometers, the Island hides a large diversity of the plant world and the many natural beauties that are most pronounced in the spring - when nature awakens. This is when the Island''s colors come to life and each color is particularly intense and attractive. These are good reasons to visit the Island outside of the main swimming season. The variety of medicinal plants that the Island abounds in, which you can best be acquainted with by walking along the trails of the Nature Park Telašćica with an expert guide, and the significant landscape of the NW of Dugi Otok, attracts more and more visitors every year and is perfect for a multi-day tour with expert guidance. Come and soak up all the colors and scents of this area. Nature Park Telašćica Nature Park Telašćica is located in the southeast of Dugi Otok. The area was declared protected in 1980, and in 1988 it gains the status of a Nature Park. The area was declared as protected due to its rich flora and fauna, geological phenomena, valuable seabed communities and interesting archaeological heritage. he bay of Telašćica is one of the largest and safest natural bays on the eastern side of the Adriatic Sea and it is also a safe haven for many boaters to protect them from the wind. The bay is 8 km inland and hides 25 coves, capes and 5 islets. Contrary to the quiet bay is the tectonic cliff locally named ˝Stene˝. The cliff rises 160 meters above the sea and goes down 85 meters in depth. Appearance-wise, the cliff seems like a naked and lifeless rock, yet it should be admired because it provides shelter and a place to live for many species that live above and below the sea without much human influence. Between the bay and the open sea is the salt lake - Mir (peace). The lake was created after the last ice age, when the sea level rose and the sea filled the karst sinkhole through the micro cracks. It is possible to go diving in several locations near the cliff within the Nature Park, and the bay itself is perfect for kayaking which may be the best form of activity that allows one to discover all of the charms that the many coves provide. The magnificence of the cliff can best be noticed while sailing below it. In order to discover the Park's mainland, we recommend taking a bike ride or hiking where you can let the environment capture you. While walking through the Park during springtime, you can smell various essential flora, and being that the Park is a protected area, it is strictly forbidden to pick them. While exploring the Park, you will come across numerous archeological sites that prove the importance and attractiveness of this area and how it was inhabited during the Paleolithic times. For the youngest, close to the salt lake Mir, there is an adrenaline park with eight devices that have a maximum height of 2.5 meters. The Adrenaline Park can be used with safety equipment that will be issued by an authorized and educated employee who will guide you through the Park. The Cove of Tripuljak has an educational underwater trail that is about 200 meters long, not demanding and intended for visitors of all ages who know how to use a mask and snorkel. The tour includes swimming and underwater sightseeing at shallow depths. An adult should accompany children under 12 years of age.

194,Sali,Triathlon Dugi Otok,"Triatlon je idealno natjecanje koje omogućuje da se otok u potpunosti doživi. Zbog svojeg položaja, veličine i raznolikosti omogućiti će natjecateljima da prođu sve njegove različitosti: pitoreskna mjesta i skrovite plaže u srazu sa veličanstvenim klifovima i bujnom vegetacijom. The hilly landscape of Dugi Otok gives walkers and cyclists' incredible views of Zadar''s maritime zone and the more demanding can enjoy the more difficult routes that intersect Dugi Otok''s landscape. A triathlon is an ideal competition that allows visitors to fully experience the Island. Due to its location, size and variety, the triathlon will allow competitors to pass through all of its diversity: picturesque villages and secluded beaches, with magnificent cliffs and lush vegetation. The coast of Dugi Otok facing the open sea is characterized by sharp contrasts, part of Nature Park Teleašćica, which is mostly steep, consists of fascinating cliffs, and on the northwestern side of the Island is the peaceful cove and sandy beach of Sakarun that is protected as a significant landscape. Swimming along the sandy beach of Sakarun, cycling along the Island (from Sakarun to Nature Park Telašćica) and running in Nature Park Telašćica, will allow for an even better experience as well as an incentive to be even faster or better. We believe that the Island will give competitors a unique experience by staying in the untouched nature that the Island offers them."
194,Sali,Traces of the past,"Active vacationers will find pleasure in exploring the island''s archeological sites (from the „oldest Dalmatian - Šime""11 000 years B.C. over burial mounds, Illyrian graves, Villa rusticae, caves, all that rocks formed 100 million years ago). Once upon a time, when Dugi Otok was as long as it is today, and possibly even longer, the fairies decided to divide the island into two parts, at the narrowest point. They dug and they dug but their work was interrupted by the dawn. And so they remained trapped in the cave of unfinished work, and so Strašna peć remained as evidence of the fairies' intent. Between fused stalactites and stalagmites, nature shaped a space similar to the vaults of Gothic basilicas. After the picturesque first hall and the penetration of daylight into the cave, you come to the second part of the cave, which emits exciting picturesqueness that shakes your soul, and the whole cave exudes romance. Vlakno is a small cave located in the middle of Dugi Otok. There is a large entrance that overlooks the Island of Rava and a smaller protected gallery that is open toward the sunny side, with a water source that used to be nearby, which made it an ideal place for smaller communities to stay since prehistoric times. This is where the „oldest Dalmatian Šime,"" 11,000 years old, was found and „his"" Lili, the Paleolithic Venus. If we go deeper into history, we will find marine reptile fossils in the area of the Brbišćica Bay that were formed hundreds of millions of years ago. Interesting karst phenomena can be found at this location: flooded and partially flooded caves, passages and pits. Due to the geomorphologic diversity of Brbišćica Bay and its surroundings, it is extremely interesting for divers and adventurers to kayak in underwater caves."

Sakarun has gained its reputation due to the whiteness of the sand and the purity of the sea as well as the benefit of being surrounded by pine trees that provide a welcoming shade during the hot summer days. The beach is approximately 600 meters long and 250 meters from the shore; the sea is 3.5 meters deep, which means that the bathing area is extremely large and shallow, making it suitable for young children. Relaxing by sipping a cocktail in the pine shade, trying to play„picigin"", beach volleyball, surfing in the late fall or just simply enjoying the turquoise sea and white sand that can be found at Sakarun. Sakarun has been named one of the twenty most beautiful natural beaches in the world and has been listed in The most beautiful bays in the world club."
194,Sali,Embraced by nature,"The imposing Veli Rat Lighthouse is located on the northwestern tip of Dugi Otok, right near the village of Veli Rat. It was built in 1849 and is 42 meters high. To this day, it is still the highest lighthouse in the Adriatic. The lighthouse owes its strikingness to its yellow façade, which, according to oral legends is because of the 100,000 egg yolks that were used in constructing the same. The Chapel of St. Nicholas is located in the courtyard of the lighthouse, which has increased in demand as a place for organizing romantic weddings. The lighthouse also offers apartment accommodationz. The lighthouse is surrounded by pine trees and beautiful coves with pebble beaches, and is considered to be one of the most beautiful in the Adriatic.

The surrounding area is perfect for biking, jogging, walking and scuba diving. Saljske užance or Sali's festival Sali''s festival, known as Saljske užance, and Donkey music are the result of long-standing traditions that are contained within the customs, traditions and legends of the islanders, who have naturally immersed themselves into the tradition and became legends of the town of Sali, encouraging the restoration of abandoned customs with their performances. When the boats from Sali sail into the port of Zadar and the loud Donkey music is heard - it is the sign that Sali's festival has begun. This festival is widely known throughout the Adriatic. Cracking jokes on the streets of Zadar and the loud Donkey music invites everyone to the three-day celebration and relaxed atmosphere. The very next night your palate will crave for food from the scents arising from Fishermen's night. With so many specialties, fish stew, sardine and tuna dishes you will not know what to taste first while acapella music enhances the gentle atmosphere of the Dalmatian night. Sport-inclined visitors that are eager to try some unusual sports will have their time to shine on the third day of the festival, which ends with the popular Night of Sali. The powerful and mystical shaking of the horns and the rhythm of drums, cymbals, old irons filled with pebbles blend into a sound that makes our skin tingle. The sound reaches into the very interior of a man that is carried by the waves capturing an enthusiastic crowd in the darkened port of Sali with compositions of «Zvončica» (little bell) and «Šjora Mare» (Signora Mare). The Festival ends on Sunday with a traditional and spectacular Donkey Race that always provides an unforgettable time."

203,Sinj,Alka Tournament,"In honour of its heavenly patroness the Madonna of Sinj, who, according to the tradition, forced the Turks into flight in 1715 (''a woman in white was seen, walking on the walls of Sinj''), as an eternal vow of devotion and respect, the people of Sinj instituted the Alka - the knights tournament of Sinj, and thus each year on the first Sunday in August the glorious victory is revived. The name Alka (Tur./Arab. halqa: ring, hoop) is derived from the details of the stirrup bottom from the saddle of a horse, seized from the Ottoman serascher-pasha Čelić. In the Alka ceremony two men lead a horse by the reins, which symbolises the Pasha's horse, the edek. The ring, alka, consists of two concentric iron circles joined by three bars, so that the distance between the circles is divided into three equal parts. The central circle, which is the smallest one, is worth three points (punat), the upper field two points, and two lower fields one point each. The knight - the Alkar - aims at full gallop at the alka with an iron-topped wooden lance. The winner of the Alka is the one who wins the highest number of points (punti) in the three races. In the event that more contestants have the same number of points, they gallop again until one of them collects more points than other(s), and this is called pripetavanje. The ceremony of Alka lasts for three days. The contest starts on Friday for the Bara, whereas the Saturday contest is called the Čoja. The solemn Sunday Alka Knights procession is led by the harambaša and the selected Alka squires (alkarski momci). They are followed by mace-bearers (buzdovandžije) and the trophy Turkish shield-bearer. At the rear of procession come the edek's guides. The troop of Alkari, who ride double-rowed, is led by the standard-bearer (carrying the Alka Knights Tournament Society banner, accompanied by the Image of the Madonna of Sinj and Croatian tricoloured flag) with henchmen and the Tournament Master (alkarski vojvoda), the commander of the procession, with his adjutant. At the rear of procession rides the commander of the Alkari, called alajčauš. The 11 Alkari at least, 15 of them at the most and exceptionally the 17 Alkari comprise the Alka procession. The Alka squires march along in the procession, together with their leader (harambaša). The Alkari, dressed in the early 18th century authentic knights attire of Sinj defenders, ride richly decorated horses. On their right side, they are armed with a lance and a sabre. An Alkar has to be born in the Cetinska Krajina Region, be hawk-eyed and have a strong right hand (oko sokolovo i čvrsta desnica). Above all, he has to be an honourable and honest man. The Tournament of Alka originated at the time when there were many similar knightly tournaments throughout Europe. All of them have now fell into oblivion, except the Alka Tournament of Sinj, which is at the dawn of its tercentenary and under protection of UNESCO as world intangible heritage. The Alka Tournament is a symbol of the struggle for freedom, peace and hearth, for faith and hope. It unites the past and the future, praises the honour and integrity, the customs of our ancestors, heroism and bravery."

A vast multitude of pilgrims comes to Sinj with only one aim - to kneel with hands clasped in front of the Miraculous Madonna of Sinj, to bow in silent prayer and gratitude to heavenly Mother, to light a candle before the Image of the Madonna and open their hearts to her grace. Many people from far away vow to pilgrim barefoot or just on foot. The day before the celebration, užežin, Sinj is already crowded with people and the hubbub, making the streets and the Church too narrow. The first mass, the traditional early service, is celebrated at 4 a. m. At 7 a.m. the sacred votive mass is celebrated in the small church at the Old Town, thus reviving the feeling of gratitude to the Madonna for having delivered us from enemy's yoke and for comforting us in many temptations. The old fortress is resonant with the song of worship The Madonna of Sinj, Holy Virgin, God has glorified you wonderfully, wonderfully, voices of the entire world celebrate you, dearest Mother of your people... At 9.30 a.m., accompanied by the solemn ringing of bells and the sound of fanfare, the Image of the Miraculous Madonna of Sinj is taken out of the Church to be brought into a solemn procession through the streets of Sinj.

The local hrvaština (‘rvašćina, hrvašćina) is a refreshing, light-bodied wine of pale-red color, made through a traditional, centuries-old method of refining grapes. This distinctive wine is an indispensable part of the enogastronomy of the town under the Kamičak Fortress. The gastronomical delights of Sinj and the Cetinska krajina region - an oasis now known for more than just its knightly tradition and stunning natural localities - are food for both the body and soul. They will take you on a journey through time, cultures, and a passion for original flavors."
203,Sinj,Manifestations,"Children's Alka Tournament of Vučkovići In memory of their ancestors Father Pavao, Bože, Tadija and Zec, whose heroism and bravery made them become prominent in the decisive battle against the Ottomans in 1715, the people in the hamlet of Vučkovići (Brnaze near Sinj) instituted in 1955 their Alka Tournament in which only children can participate. The Children's Alka was naturally instituted following the example of the famous Alka of Sinj. In the Children's Alka of Vučkovići, boys up to 10 years of age run on their feet. Their Alka squires are elderly local people, whereas those oldest from the hamlet play the roles of the Alka Court of Honour and the Alka Tournament Master (alkarski vojvoda). In the Children's Alka procession the standard-bearer rides a horse, a donkey is a symbol of edek (the Pasha's horse) and the Tournament Master's adjutant carries the sabre of the hero Bože Vučković."
203,Sinj,Prosciutto fair,"Since 2006, Sinj has hosted the National Fair of Prosciutto Ham and Dry-Cured Meat Products with International Participation which has been held annually in April. Preparations for the ninth prosciutto ham fair have been encouraged by the general interest in this traditional event bringing together all those involved in the prosciutto ham industry, from pig breeders, producers and distributors of prosciutto ham and dry-cured meat products to Government and professional institutions, distributors and meat industry equipment producers. S.A.R.S. Festival The Sinj Meeting of Amateur Rock Groups (S.A.R.S.) is an alternative culture festival organised by the Sinj Cultural Urban Movement (S.K.U.P.) association. Held annually at the end of July, the festival has been running for over ten years now. It all started in 2003, with the original purpose of promoting amateur rock groups from all over Croatia. Over the years, however, famous groups from both Croatia and abroad have played at the festival. As a result, Sinj has been visited by large audiences not only from nearby places, such as Imotski, Split and Knin, but also from more distant places. The following groups have so far performed at the S.A.R.S. festival and other music events organised by the S.K.U.P. association: Let 3, Dubioza kolektiv, Dječaci, Gužva u 16-tercu, Massimo Savić, T.B.F., Gustafi, Raising Dream, Cold Snap, Father and many others."
203,Sinj,Rural Products Fair,"Since 2009, Sinj has hosted the Rural Products Fair. Small and medium-sized agricultural holdings of Sinj rural area are given an advantageous opportunity to acquaint consumers with traditional homemade products which can hardly be found in any other place. Visitors can taste and buy from assorted high quality food products: a selection of homemade cheeses, honey and other bee products, homemade smoked and cured meats, wines, brandies (rakija), liqueurs, oils, eco products, etc. A wide variety of traditional souvenirs, different types of hand embroidery, utensils and decorative items as well as natural material jewellery are also exhibited. Cultural clubs and Sinj majorettes further enrich the whole programme. The 1715 Siege of Sinj Performance Over past few years and under cover of August night, authentic locations of the Old Town and Sinj Town (varoš) have staged the events having taken place prior to the glorious victory over the Ottomans on 15 August 1715. By the script written by Prof Velimir Borković, the start of the performance is the announcement of the coming of more than 40 000 of Ottoman soldiers from Bosnia over Prolog, the pass in the Kamešnica Mountain, at the end of July 1715. Led by Mehmed Pasha Ćelić, their aim was to conquer the people in the valley of the Cetina River, and above all, to impose their rule on Sinj. The people of Sinj, however, led by Father Ivan Grčić, rejected an ultimatum and preparations were under way by 700 of them for the defence of the Town, both from Kamičak fort and the Old Town fortress. Klape (Dalmatian harmony-singing groups) to the Madonna of Sinj Festival The Organising Committee for the tercentenary celebration of the miraculous defence of Sinj, which is to be held under the auspices of the Croatian Parliament, initiated the holding of the Klape to the Madonna of Sinj Festival of spiritual harmony singing to the Virgin Mary, but it has also launched a number of projects over the seven-year preparation period for the tercentenary celebration (2015). The Festival has been held in Sinj early in August since 2009, during the Alka and Feast of Assumption Days. The humanitarian quality of the Festival has been reflected in the fact that gate receipts and CD sales receipts have been given away to the humanitarian Madonna of Sinj Foundation, whose principal aim is to provide underprivileged students with financial support. Music evenings at Kamičak fort Thanks to the rich material and intangible cultural heritage, as well as a number of various cultural events, the town of Sinj and the Cetinska krajina region have already made their gold mark on the tourist map of Croatia. The manifestations in the Alka town have been attracting more attention and visitors thanks to the aspiration towards sustainable tourism and coexistence of carefully planned activities, in which both the locals and guests enjoy. One of such described events are the Music Evenings at Kamičak Fort."
203,Sinj,Cetina River,"Mysterious and hitherto insufficiently explored, the karst beauty is the longest river in Central Dalmatia. Both divers and explorers have been intrigued by its vast labyrinths of underground streams, but the crystal clear and cold queen-like river seems to have remained indifferent to that. In a dignified manner, it endowes its plains with fresh life, gives drink to people and cattle and power to the turbines of hydropower plants, whereas the precious grain are ground under the stone mill wheels... The Cetina River rises to an elevation of 385 metres in the northwestern slopes of the Dinarides, near the village of Cetina, and 7 kilometres north of the Town of Vrlika. The River has no less than eight sources, among which the largest one is the Glavaševo Lake, 130 metres in depth. Gospodska pećina cave, an opening located about one hundred metres above the source, served as shelter for a lot of people during various epochs. The banks and the mountain slopes surrounding the Cetina River shelter rich archaeological sites. A number of valuable finds, witnessing the time they date from, have been found in the surrounding karst area and in the River silt. The archaeological finds have been put on display in the Sinj Museum of the Cetinska Krajina Region."
203,Sinj,Kosinac Spring,"Water is the source of life. Whoever once quenched thirst with water from the Kosinac spring will say that the taste of relish is its second name. Freshness beyond words tickles one's palate, giving life and energy to one's spirit. The name of the Kosinac spring has brought to light and saved from oblivion the fact of the Croatian people's relationship to remote ancestors in White Croatia. Even today, a hundred years since Sinj has been supplied with water from Kosinac, the spring remains a relief oasis. The shade of a track in the age-old trough, unspoilt nature, thousands of rainbows hiding under the sun's ray and a firm stone here and there, standing in the way of the nimble stream, create both an image and a sound of unpredictability and uniqueness, a feast for the senses."
203,Sinj,Significant Landscape of Sutina,"The significant landscape of Sutina has been under protection since 2000. The landscape's area of 426.80 ha includes the upper canyon part of the Sutina stream, a tributary of the Cetina River. Due to its unusual vegetation arrangement, the canyon of Sutina, a rapid mountain stream, makes a typical example of botanical inversion. From the lowest point of the canyon to the peaks of the surrounding hills you can see beech (Fagus sylvatica), eastern hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and oak (Quercus virgiliana), while the rocky meadows abound with everlasting (Helichrysum italicum), sage (Salvia officinalis), winter savory (Satureja montana), oregano (Origanum sp.), thyme (Thymus serpyllum) and many more. There are many different butterflies flying around the flowers of these plants in search of nectar, such as swallowtail (Papilio machaon), black-veined white (Aporia crataegi), along with diverse families, as those of the whites (Pieridae), brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae), the browns (Satyridae) and gossamer-winged butterflies (Lycaenidae)."
203,Sinj,Significant Landscape of Rumin,"The significant landscape of Rumin has been under protection since 2000. The landscape's area of 33.5 ha includes Little Rumin (Mali Rumin) and Great Rumin (Veliki Rumin), which represent the source of Rumin, the second longest tributary of the Cetina River. While Little Rumin dries up during summer, Great Rumin that springs at the foot of the Greda cliff never dries up. The steep cliffs of Rumin, a tributary of the Cetina River, house bird species such as the raven (Corvus corax), the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and the eagle owl (Bubo bubo). The wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) and the Greek partridge (Alectoris graeca) nest on the karst slopes at the foot of the cliffs. Plains, fields and ploughland are the natural home of the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), the quail (Coturnix coturnix) and the crested lark (Galerida cristata). The long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) builds its ball-like nests on the crowns of the willow trees along the Rumin tributary, while the basket-like nests of the golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus) are sheltered by the oak tree boughs. The old oak trees often get visited by the great-spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) in search of food, whereas the Rumin tributary provides the food for the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)."
203,Sinj,Miletin Spring,"The Miletin spring is one of the famous springs in Sinj, situated northwestwards at the foot of the historic fortress of Sinj. The spring is mentioned in the works of ancient writers as well as in folk songs and tales of Sinj, as one of the several springs in the Town of Sinj with water of high quality and excellent flavour. The people of Sinj used Miletin as a source of drinking water, but also for watering their cattle and washing their clothes. The supply of Petrovac fountain, which is located in very centre of Sinj, with water from Miletin spring dates back to 1878. Over time, however, the Miletin was neglected, particulary in 1912 when Sinj was supplied with quality drinking water from Kosinac spring. In 1984, a campaign was launched by the people of Sinj to restore this valuable spring to its former good condition. The result of the campaign was spring catchment and the building of a concrete fence wall. In 2013, the area was landscaped by building access paths and stone steps, placing benches and planting various ornamental plants."
203,Sinj,Greda,"Greda is a unique biotope and an exceptional oasis of tranquillity, where you can take the opportunity to escape from the stress of everyday life. An ideal place to do sports or simply relax without being disturbed. The natural and fine sedimentary rock that is characteristic for the area is called muljika (mud) by the residents of Sinj. Experts agree that the Poljakova greda and Šušnjevača mountains must be preserved and protected at all costs, due to the biodiversity, the breath-taking scenery as well as the unique geological and pedological characteristics. The vegetation in mountains dominated by siltstone cannot be compared with the vegetation in surrounding karst areas dominated by limestone. Biogeographically speaking the Greda mountains belong to the sub-Mediterranean climate zone. The tree vegetation consists mainly of downy oak and the oriental hornbeam. Under the tree crowns a dry grassland, which is typically found in south-eastern Europe, the Scorzonero-Chrysopogonetalia, has grown. This is another indicator for the rich plant habitat of the biotope."
203,Sinj,Sights,"Kamičak Fort One of the most scenic and memorable symbols of Sinj, located in the very town centre, opposite the Church of the Miraculous Madonna of Sinj. Kamičak is a star-shaped fort, built in 1712 on the hill of the same name. The home master builders Ignacije Macanović and Jakov Cincidela participated in its building. In the south-west, it is joined to the pertaining kvartir (the cavalry barracks), the today's Alka Knights Court (Alkarski dvori). Kamičak's present-day layout dates back to 1890 when the walls were built and the pine trees planted. A tower that used to serve as an observatory is built in the fort. On the tower there is a clock ringing three minutes before the hour, and ticking on the hour. At the top of the tower there is a bronze bell cast in the foundry of the famous Italian family Colbachini."
203,Sinj,Old Town,"Remnants of the old fortress, that the people of Sinj simply call the Town, have been faithful to watch over Sinj even today, after the passage of centuries. It harboured the people and soldiers during Turkish invasions, guarded and protected the weak, resisted invaders. In the centre of the fortress there was St Michael's church in which, on the altar of St Barbara, the Franciscans from Rama laid the precious and miraculous image of the Mother of Mercy. In 1699, through the advocacy of Father Pavao Vučković, in the town at the foot of the old fortress the building of St Mary's church began. The church was completed in 1712. There is little left of the fortress itself. After 1709, 1768 and 1796 earthquakes and repeated barbarian invasions, the old fortified walls of Sinj yielded so the people began to settle in Podvaroš, at the foot of the hill. A small church, which is nowadays at the Town, was built in 1887, in commemoration of two centuries of arrival of the people of Cetina from Rama. It is a symbol of a vow, a close alliance and devotion which have for centuries bound the Cetina people to the Mother of God. In 2008, in honour of their eternal heavenly patroness, the people of Sinj built at the Town a bronze statue of the Madonna of Sinj, the work of the academic sculptor Josip Marinović."
203,Sinj,Church of the Miraculous Madonna of Sinj,"Peaceful and majestic, framed with the bronze door in relief made by the academic sculptor Stipe Sikirica, the Church of the Miraculous Madonna of Sinj dominates the town main square. Built during the 1699-1712 period, it has preserved its original appearance, though many times damaged resisting wars and earthquakes. The Image of the Miraculous Madonna of Sinj takes the central place, both in the Church and in the hearts of the people of Sinj. It is a work of an unknown painter, dating back to the 15th or 16th century. With her head slightly tilted and eyes lowered, she has devotedly watched over her people, ever since they, driven off by the Turks, brought her along from Rama as the greatest treasure and hope to the Cetinska Krajina Region. Legend has it that in 1715 Sinj was once and for all delivered from Turkish rule with the help of her miraculous influence."
203,Sinj,The Stations of the Cross,"The inhabitants of Sinj consider their old fortress town very special because it is more than just a historical centre. A votive church was erected on top of the fortress on the 200th anniversary of the migration of the people of the Cetina region from Rama to Sinj. In front of the church is a statue of the Virgin Mary, the work of sculptor Josip Marinović, whose solemn and majestic gaze watches over Sinj and its surroundings. The Way of the Cross has been worshipped here since 1996, and a path for it was built in 2001. In the same year, fourteen renowned Croatian sculptors were commissioned to create life-size bronzes representing the fourteen Stations of the Cross. Thanks to various private and institutional funds, and to the delight of believers, pilgrims and travelers, the project was completed and the Sanctuary of the Miraculous Lady of Sinj considered a valuable artistic, cultural, and religious work in which is to be found in the peaceful centuries-old forest."
203,Sinj,Sinj,"In the heart of Dalmatia lies the picturesque town of Sinj, surrounded by untouched nature and rich cultural heritage. This ancient city exudes tradition and character, with its narrow cobbled streets bearing witness to a storied history. Sinj is renowned for the knightly game of Alka, dating back centuries, while the Kamičak fortress dominates the horizon, attesting to the city's strategic importance. With scenic landscapes and welcoming locals, Sinj offers a unique experience of authentic Dalmatian life, inviting visitors to explore its enchantments. Bajagić Bajagić is a settlement of remarkable natural beauty and it is located about 4 km away from the town of Sinj. Bajagić borders the edge of the Hrvatačko polje and lies between the suburbs of Rumin, Han and Obrovac Sinjski. It is located on the left bank of the Cetina River, the main artery of this area, as it is popularly known. Bajagić rises on average altitude of 350 m above sea level. There is no bridge that spans over the river in the suburb itself. The closest bridges are in the settlements of Rumin (in Panj village) and Han. The Church of St. Nicholas is located in Bajagić. The church was built in 1937 in neo-romantic style out of natural stone. The medieval cemetery, an archaeological site in the fields along the Malin stream (left tributary of the Cetina), is a protected monument of culture. The archaeological remains of the ancient tombstones and plates that once were visible are expected to be found underground. The cemetery has not yet been fully explored by archaeologists, but scientists agree that it is most likely to be assigned to the classical old Croatian period between the 9th and the 12th century."
203,Sinj,Brnaze,"Brnaze is one of the most progressive and most densely populated villages on the outskirts of the city of Sinj - the suburb has around 50 different commercial service companies as well as companies in the fields of trade and catering, meaning that the suburb partly takes on the characteristics of a town. Archeological discoveries that provide new insights into early Christianity were collected on Brnaška glavica, the hill above Brnaze. The remains of the old Croatian church of St. Michael are located on the Mioljača, a part of the suburb Brnaze, and they consist of six apses from the 9th or 10th century. This church again was probably built on the foundations of the early Christian church. Fragments of church stone furniture from the early Croatian period, a part of an early Christian altar wall as well as some ancient monuments were discovered. Late medieval graves were found in and around the church, from which other objects were also extracted (rings, earrings, bridles and coins). Čitluk Čitluk is a village situated north of the town of Sinj, between the Cetina River and the surrounding villages of Hrvace, Karakašica, Jasensko and Glavice. The suburb extends from the river channel of the Cetina along the edge of the Hrvatačko polje towards Jasensko, over the hills and valleys between these two places. On the other side of the river, located directly opposite one another, is the village of Bajagić. The village displays the typical features of the areas of the Zagora and of the Centinska Krajina and has a centuries-lasting, but hardly explored history. The Roman city of Colonia Claudia Aequum, whose roots go back to the 1st century A.D., probably to the time of Emperor Augustus (certainly to the time of Emperor Claudius), was once located on the site of today's Čitluk. At that time, it had the status of an oppidum civium Romanorum (settlement of the citizens of the Roman Empire). Among the numerous valuable objects found here, both the statue of Hecate and the head of Heracles stand out. Both sculptures are part of the archaeological collection of the Franciscan monastery in Sinj. The Roman general Gnaeus Minicius Faustinus Sextus Iulius Severus came from Aequum, who suppressed the uprising of the Jews and destroyed Jerusalem in 135. An amphitheater is also believed to exist in this area, which served as a scene for bloody battles between gladiators."
203,Sinj,Glavice,"Glavice is one of the most populous villages in the Cetinska krajina. Mainly cattle breeding is practiced there, but also agriculture, largely thanks to the fertile Sinjsko polje - the field of Sinj. The beautiful, old legend of the place, which in the Croatian language bears the somewhat unusual name Smradovo (""smrad"", in English: stench), says that the village not only has the most fertile soil, but also the purest source of the spring Jaža. Legend has it that Saint George threw the dragon's tail into this spring after he had defeated him. The suburb is characterized by many hills and knolls (Croatian ""glavice""), after which the village is named. The natural treasures as well as the beauties of this area have attracted many adventurers and investors. On the hill Križ (in Englsih: cross), there is a 9.5 m high cross covered with granite and marble, where reliefs and biblical quotations can be admired. It was built exactly where the old cross once stood but was eventually destroyed during the Second World War. The Križ hill offers a majestic view over the entire Cetinska krajina."
203,Sinj,Gljev,"Gljev is a village located 15 km away from Sinj - in the highlands above the Sinjsko polje, on the mountain slopes of the Kamešnica, not far from the Croatian-Bosnian-Herzegovinian border. Most of the commercial and residential properties are located on the south-western slopes of the Kamešnica, along the fertile fields in the Karst region. As in most of the suburbs around the Cetina, Gljev experienced a demographic decline at the end of the 20th century. The reason for that was the relocation of the working population, who preferred the surrounding cities of Sinj and Split. The reasons being of a very pragmatic nature indeed: available jobs, many educational opportunities and better living conditions in general. The residents of Gljev take pride in preserving their traditional customs: making opanci (Croatian ""opanak"", in English: closed traditional sandals) and celebrating their ancestors' traditional customs of Kamešnica during the carnival season. The Church of Saint Jerome and Saint Peter, which is not only a protected cultural monument but also an archaeological site, is located in the settlement as well. Outside the cemetery, there is a small number of late medieval headstones."
203,Sinj,Jasensko,"Jasensko is a village located east of Karakašica and south of Čitluk. The villages, which are not far from each other, adorn the diverse landscape, which is ideal for adventurous excursions, long walks or even cycling along the newly constructed bicycle paths. Back in 1999, a new church was built between the villages of Jasensko and Čitluk and it was dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi. Karakašica Karakašica is a village located west of Jasensko and north of Lučane. There are breathtakingly beautiful landscapes as far as the eye can see. Saint Leopold Bogdan Mandić (Croatian priest of the Capuchin Order, a very popular confessor and the second Croat who was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church - after Nikola Tavelić), is the patron saint of both the local church as well as the suburb. He passed away in Padua, Italy, in 1942. His feast day is celebrated in the Croatian Church Calendar on May 12th. Lučane Lučane is a village that is located in the extremely fertile valley between the mountain slopes of Radošić, Sušanj and Gaj. Despite insufficient scientific research, the archaeological findings to date suggest the existence of an earlier prehistoric settlement. The existence of prehistoric pile dwellings is believed to exist on the small rivers Sutina and Točilo (towards Karakašica). The ancient Illyrian settlement Setovia is also suspected to be located on the hill Sušanj, which is known for Roman emperor Augustus' campaign against the Dalmatae - an Illyrian tribe, from which the name of today's Croatian Dalmatia county originates. Experts believe that the ancient main road that connected the towns of Andetrium (today's Muć) and Aequum (Čitluk) ran through Lučane. Some late antique tombs have also been discovered, dated between the 3rd and 6th century. The patron saint of the suburb is Saint Catherine, to whom the parish church is dedicated. Her feast is traditionally celebrated on November 25th and, according to the old saying, she brings snow (""Sveta Kata, snijeg na vrata"", meaning in English: When St. Catherine's feast is just around the corner, it will snow). Radošić Radošić is a village in the Karst highlands between Mount Visoka and the town of Sinj. It is considered to be one of the suburbs that, due to its urban growth, makes already a part of the city itself. The suburb extends over 3 km and the nature of the various small villages within it is characterized by the specific terrain of the mountain. Visoka (892 m) is a mountain that is located above Sinj. More precisely, Visoka is the southeastern mountain slope of the Svilaja Mountain, which is separated from the mountain itself by the steep river valley called Sutina. This 13 m high cross is located on the peak of Visoka and was built there back in 1933 on the occasion of the 1900th anniversary of the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The cross, which can be seen from all the villages of the Cetinska krajina, is considered a protection and a blessing for the entire surrounding area. Every year on the Sunday before the Uzvišenje sv. Križa (Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross; 14th September) many believers make a pilgrimage to the cross. It is generally a popular place for hikers, mountaineers and people who like to go on trips. The mountain top offers a breathtaking view: on the one hand the town of Sinj, the Sinjsko polje and their surroundings and on the other hand the valley basin with the town of Dicmo and, farther out, the sea and islands."
203,Sinj,Obrovac Sinjski - Han,"Obrovac Sinjski, a village located about 4 km far away from the town of Sinj, lies on the left bank of the river Cetina along the north-eastern edge of the Hrvatačko polje, near the villages Bajagić, Gala and Glavice. In the nearby village Han, you can see a bridge that spans the Cetina River and it is actually the only transport route to the nearby town of Sinj. That bridge is the second in range, downstream of the Peruća dam. It was built near the destroyed Ottoman bridge as part of the trade route that in ancient times led from Salona (today's Solin) across the Cetina river into the Roman province of Dalmatia - and back in the Middle Ages then from Split via Klis towards Livno. The bridge was essential for both passenger and freight transport. In their time, the Ottomans built a place to stay next to the bridge with a small tavern or han in it (Turkish: ← pers . Hān, hāne: house), to which today's suburb Han owes its name. The need for such a construction arose because of the numerous trade caravans that regularly traveled to Split from the Eyâlet or Paschalik Bosnia, which was a province of the Ottoman Empire. The bridge was destroyed during the Venetian-Austrian Turkish War (1714-1718), during which the glorious Battle of Sinj also took place in 1715. Ever since the destruction of the bridge, the river Cetina has been crossed solely by ships (from Kerep, a place in the suburb of Otok). Suhač Suhač is a village located north of Sinj, at an altitude of 380 m above sea level. Suhač was mentioned for the first time in 1341, around the same time as Sinj was mentioned for the first time during the Middle Ages. Nowadays, Suhač attracts many sports enthusiasts who enjoy the newly prepared promenades towards the 4 km long, moderate hiking trail, called Pavića nebesa."
203,Sinj,Turjaci,"Turjaci is a village located 4 km from Sinj along the southwestern edge of the Sinjsko polje and the expressway that connects the cities of Sinj and Trilj. In Turjaci, you can see the church of Saint Anthony of Padua, whom the local residents commemorate and celebrate every year on June 13th with an occasional procession and a folk festival. Numerous archaeological finds testify to the impressive and exciting history of Turjaci. There is a long tradition of dealing with agriculture and cattle breeding, especially with the famous high-quality and particularly fine sand from Turjaci, known as turjačka pržina. At the equestrian competition Sinjska alka, it is still the only type of sand that is scattered over the track both during the preparations and the festival itself. Turjaci is also home to the Pržina traditional bowling club, which takes part in the traditional bowling league of the Split-Dalmatia County. In addition, the association takes part in a wide variety of social and charitable activities, actively encouraging younger generations to participate in sports and always making its contribution to promote culture and the spirit of sport."
203,Sinj,Zelovo,"Zelovo is located at the bottom of the southern slopes of the Svilaja Mountains that determine both the location of the village as well as the peculiarities of the local residents' everyday life. Zelovo is located 14 km away from Sinj and 7 km away from the Hrvace commune, which are also the closest settlements one to another. The mountains Plišivica, Gradina and Orlove stine (in English: Eagle Rocks) are also located in the vicinity of the area. They are magnificent cliffs of Mount Svilaja, famous for the temporary settlement of griffon vultures during their migration to the island of Cres, in Croatia, as well as to the Julian Alps, in Slovenia. In the village there is also the church of St. Vitus, the holy patron saint of Zelovo, who is celebrated every year on June 15th. Zelovo is known for making local tobacco pipes, called zelovske lule, made from baked clay. These tobacco pipes were made in this way exclusively in Zelovo and nowhere else in Croatia. In addition, the residents of the suburb also made cigarette holders, wooden toys, furniture and everyday objects (rakes, pitchforks) as well as decorative objects, wooden dishes, traditional bowling balls and musical instruments (bagpipes, double-row shepherd's flutes, the string instrument gusla and various wind instruments). Almost every single household in Zelovo was considered to be its own production drive for a wide variety of handcrafts. The beginnings of tobacco pipe production go back to the first half of the 18th century, when families with the surnames Delaš, Domazet and Jukić moved to Zelovo. Those families boosted the production of pipes and cigarette holders, while the families with the surname Gabrić took care of selling those manufactured products. Today, Zelovo is a popular place not only for leisure travelers and mountaineers from all over Dalmatia but also for people who travel from far further away. In winter, the moment the first snowflakes fall in the area, it is teeming with enthusiastic visitors who not only indulge in the natural beauties and the richness of all the plant and animal life of this region but also like to enjoy the relaxing atmosphere and the cheerful company in the mountain hut Orlove stine."

205,Skradin,Skradin Mulberry,"Mulberries give the landscape around Skradin a distinct look and serve as witnesses of its silk-producing past. In the first half of the 19th century, Skradin was the site of the biggest silkworm and domestic silkmoth farm in Dalmatia. Among the most important silk processing plants was the Rose family silk farm, built around 1840. At the end of the century, the production of silk cocoons experienced a sharp decline because of a spreading disease that affected mulberry trees. In early 20th century, Skradin remained the only place in Dalmatia that still produced cocoons and silk. Production came to a standstill leading up to WWI because of low prices. In honour of the industry that fed the population of Skradin, the longest street in town that has a row of mulberries was named ""Skradin Silk Farmers' Avenue"" (Aleja skradinskih svilara), and the town also hosts a unique summer theatre festival called ""Theatre under the mulberries"" (Glumište pod murvom). The centuries-old mulberry trees in the Skradin area now offer shade and shelter to younger generations, and their fruits, leaves and bark are used to make sweets and medicinal beverages. Skradin's rich history: from destruction to preservation! Skradin, which got its name during the Roman era, is one of the oldest towns in Croatia, whose history can be traced back to Illyrian times. The ancient Scardona was a Roman municipium, port and stronghold for the army, as well as an important centre of trade. After the town had been destroyed and ravaged during the Migration Period, it was rebuilt by Croats, who named it Skradin. It became the seat of a bishopric as early as the 6th century, and in late 13th century, it also became one of the seats of the House of Šubić, the princes of Bribir, who gave the town its charter and made it the capital of Croatia and Bosnia. Because of its favourable geostrategic position, fertile soil and plenty of freshwater sources, Avars, Turks and Venetians all ravaged the town at different points throughout history. Such a tumultuous history is reflected in the town's valuable cultural and historical heritage, seen at every corner."

211,Solin,Attractions,"St. Mary's Church at Our Lady's Isle In the very centre of Salona, on a river islet (Gospin otok - Our Lady's Islet) in the delta of Salona's river Salon, now known as the Jadro, next to the parish church of St. Mary, Our Lady of the Islet (Sv. Marija, Gospa od Otoka), there is an exceptionally valuable archaeological site, now totally covered with earth. The present parish church was built in 1880. To its south there is a grassy area where thousands of believers attended the mass on the occasion of the visit of Pope John Paul II, in 1998. Gašpina watermill The mill ""Gašpina mlinica"" is one of the only preserved mills on the Jadro River. It was built in the early 18th century and the first records of it date back to 1711. Its structure consists of four low buildings in a row with gable roofs covered with stone plates. Over the centuries, its structure has been modified and upgraded, which is evident from the subsequently created windows on the facade. The building faces a north-south orientation and the water was directed through the channels from the east, free-falling to the lower parts of the mill, i.e. to the wires attached to the axles. The doors and windows mainly face west. An ancient stone stele was placed above the main entrance. The inside of the mill contains the static stone parts of the mill with stone water wheels."
211,Solin,Hollow Church,"Close by the Jadro, to the east of Salona, there are remains of churches on the site known for centuries by the local people by the true, descriptive name of Šuplja crkva (Hollow Church). The name originates from the time when here there were walls of an unattended church with a collapsed roof, recorded on the Camuci's map of 1571. Remains of a three-aisled basilica, dedicated to Ss. Peter and Moses (sv. Petar i Mojsije) appear to have existed at the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries, when the newly arrived inhabitants of Solin named them so picturesquely. The church is from the 11th century, linked with the coronation of Zvonimir as a Croatian king in 1075, built within a large early-Christian basilica, probably from the 6th century. Next to the church, there was a Benedictine monastery, possibly connected with the dynasty, which is a possible reason why the new church was built within the old one, to become the site of such an important event. This fact has made this early-Romanesque three-aisled basilica particularly famous. Rižinice Rižinice are plots of land in the fertile valley of Rupotina, on the eastern slopes of Mount Kozjak, where remains of a small church and buildings deemed to have been a part of a monastery complex have been found. Below them, there flows the creek called Ilijino vrilo (Elia' Spring), surfacing near Crikvina, where there are remains of another small church and an old-Christian monastery. The location of these monasteries, if the structures were indeed monasteries, remind one of the saying Bernardus valles, Benedictus colles amabat, i.e. St. Bernard liked dwelling in the valleys, St. Benedict on the hills. The small number of friars (there would be at least three) had enough land at both locations, in Rižinice and Crkvina, to live humbly. The locality attracted attention in 1891 when a fragment was found of an altar screen gable, with a legible inscription ""... PRO DUCE TREPIM(ERO)..."" linking it directly with the Croatian Prince Trpimir (about 845-865)."
211,Solin,Gradina,"Among the remains of the Solin buildings, of particular interest is the complex known as Gradina (Hill-Fort), next to the very river and the Roman town's eastern walls. A church of an unusual ground plan, built over the Roman epoque remains, is today situated within a medieval fortress. This was built, according to some authors (F. Bulić and Lj. Karaman), by the Split archbishop Ugolino de Mala Branca (1349-1388) to protect the people of Split from the people of Klis. Today, it is in a fortress built during the Venetian-Turkish wars, in the 16th century. It was researched in 1909-1911 and again in 1923-1925, its ground plan and volume have recently been presented in drawings by J. Marasović, which is a convincing reconstruction. The church was for the first time correctly dated to the time of the Byzantine emperor Justinian (527-567) by M. Prelog, some fifty years ago."
211,Solin,Tusculum Museum,"Manastirine Necropolis is the best preserved, explored and maintained complex at Salona and includes a building called Tusculum. Frane Bulić ordered the construction of this building for the First Early Christianity Archaeology Conference, held in Solin and Split in 1894. The world's most renowned scholars of early Christianity attended the conference. The building was intended as the headquarters for archaeological teams that were undertaking excavations in Solin, and also a place for recreational and scientific meetings. Bulić named the building ""Tusculum"" after Cicero's villa near Rome, precisely to imitate the famous Roman politician and philosopher. It was built in the spirit of those times, with a large number of fragments installed, and a fountain was built in the garden, containing the fragments of the former bell tower of the Romanesque cathedral in Split. Today, Tusculum mainly serves its original purpose - on the ground floor, there is a small memorial collection that serves as a reminder of the notable archaeologist and his times, while the first floor contains rooms where teams of archaeologists currently live and work, excavating and researching monuments in the Solin area."
211,Solin,Zvonimir Cultural Centre,"The Zvonimir Cultural Centre in Solin was established in 1991. Today, it has 11 employees who prepare and manage various cultural events, publishing activities, restoration of ancient ceramics and the production of authentic souvenirs based on the Salona, i.e. old Croatian monuments.

211,Solin,A walk down Zvonimirova lane,"Our walk along Zvonimirova, the central street in Solin, starts with its display on the Austro-Hungarian cadastral map dating from 1860. Since then, the street has significantly changed its appearance, but it has remained the lifeblood of the town along the Jadro River. Walking through the memories of Solin, we will show what it looked like in the first half of the last century."
211,Solin,Gastronomy,"As it is located by the Jadro River, Solin offers a wide variety of culinary delights including trout prepared in various ways, grilled eel, and the local dishes, all served in the pleasant ambiance of the Solin restaurants. Your palate will surely remember your visit to Solin... Have you decided to try some of the Solin traditional dishes after seeing all the town's attractions? You may try some of the traditional recipes such as Trout alla Jadro, Queen Jelena's stake, grilled eels or Diocletian's pancakes. Read some of the many recipes from the traditional Solin cookbook ""Notes from Medo's Kitchen"" that will take you back to the times of the ancient Salona and Croatian rulers..."
211,Solin,The Amphitheatre,"At the northwest end of Salona's town limits, subsequently fortified, there is an amphitheatre, which forms part of the town defence system. Its remains are comparatively well-preserved (much worse than the one in Pula, though), showing the benefits of the well known reconstruction made by the Danish archaeologist Ejnar Dyggve. The first excavations, made in the end of the 1840s, were initiated by F. Carrara, who was also responsible for the first and very systematic archeological research of this town and its archaeological research. In 1850 he published a book on the Salonitan topography and excavations undertaken earlier, which is still very valuable and useful. Excavations of the amphitheatre were continued until much later: before and during the First World War (F. Bulić), and again in 1929 as part of studies of this edifice performed for the purpose of a comprehensive monograph published in 1932 (E. Dyggve)."
211,Solin,Basilica urbana,"Salona's main ecclesiastical centre was created next to the first Christian oratorium that was located in a private house, in the so-called domus ecclesiae . It was in an area surrounded on the western side by town walls, in the east by a street leading to the small gates in the north town walls, and on the southern side by the street passing through the old town gate known as Porta Caesarea. In the remains of the private house next to the town walls, the oratorium hall with its semicircular apse is visible, complete with a stone bench for the priests and the altar-screen base. This is believed to have been the first Christian oratorium, called Oratorium A by Dyggve. In its vicinity, to the south, there was another one, that Dyggve called Oratorium B. Bulić, too, considered this was where the Christian community was meeting at the time of Domnio, the first Salonitan bishop. To the west, there was a door and before it there was a small atrium with a fountain (the thermae and water installations were in the vicinity). Later on, Gabričević differed in his opinion that the oratorium was built at the time of Venancius, probably the first Christian community in the locality at the beginning of the second half of the third century."
211,Solin,Jadro Excursion Site,"The history of Solin, Split and the surrounding area is closely connected to the river Jadro, which is rich in drinking water, and this significance has been maintained until today. However, apart from the fact that the river that rises at the foot of Mosor was and remains an important source of water for the surrounding population and settlements, its value is much greater. Along the river there are many valuable monuments of ancient and Croatian history, as well as natural and industrial heritage of the recent era. As part of the ""Jadro-spring of life"" project, all these motifs of the river are integrated. The Jadro excursion site unites the economic, cultural and natural wealth that the river has signified throughout history and the cultures that lived along it and preserved it in its original form. The Jadro River was an inexhaustible inspiration for the planning of the excursion site, where it plays the main role of the narrator who tells all the important events in the first person, from the very beginnings, all the way to the present day. It guides visitors through all the corners of time that it has witnessed. The symbolism of the continuous flow, which was there before us and will be there long after our time, is the link that allows us to tell the story with a line that creates so many different shapes and leads the visitors through different spaces in an innovative way so that visitors get a complete experience and immersion to the understanding of the river that means life. Sometimes moderate and mild, sometimes unpredictable and complex, the line is also a symbol of time seen through the eyes of the Jadro, which has remained preserved through the centuries and will be here for a long time as a valuable legacy that we preserve from oblivion for all those who are yet to discover the true greatness of this small river."
211,Solin,Swamp cypress,"( Taxodium distichum ) The flora in the Solin area spreads across several zones. The foothill is a green zone that features rich Mediterranean vegetation, orchards, vineyards and fields of fertile ground. The Oriental hornbeam, downy oak, South European flowering ash, St Lucy cherry and European Cornel can all be found here. Above this area, the vegetation is mainly scrubby with visible traces of forests. Sage, immortelle and absinthium grow on the barren land, lending special charm to the mountain with their scents. A very rare specimen of the swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum) grows in Solin by the Jadro River. The age of this tree has been estimated to be 90 years and it is 25 meters high. This is not an autochthonous species and its natural habitat are the swamps by the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. The cypress was protected in 1996 as a natural monument."
211,Solin,Solin,"Like the entire area of the Central Dalmatia, Solin is characterized by a very favourable climate. Its weather is distinctly Mediterranean, with mild, mostly wet winters and dry, hot and sunny summers. This favourable climate is also influenced by the local and periodic (seasonal) winds, including the southeast wind (jugo) and the northeast wind (bura) that blow throughout the year, most strongly in winter when their bioclimatic effect is the most keenly felt. The most characteristic winds in the early spring and summer are the northwest wind (maestral) which has a considerable thermoregulating effect, i.e. directs cooler air from the sea. Annual rainfall is approximately 800 mm, evenly distributed, so that spring and summer are mostly dry with moderate amounts of rain during autumn and winter. Snow is rare."
211,Solin,Town history,"Writing a brief summary of the history of Solin, formerly the capital of a Roman provinence and describing its improtant monuments, is a task both appealing and hard. It is well known that Salona disappeared at the end of classical epoque, never to be renewed again. In the middle ages, the Salonitan town area, the entire former Salonitan ager, established at the end of Roman republic, was between three important centres that were often in collision: between the towns of Trogir and Split, and the Klis fortress, for a long time in possession of the Croaitan dignitary families and then by Turks. This inevitably determined the destiny of the former town of Salona, the present Solin, and its environments."
212,Šolta,Maslinica,"The south side of the bay boasts a beautiful pine wood with secluded rocky beaches. In front of it lies an archipelago of seven islets (Polebrnjak, Saskinja, Stipanska, Kamik, Balkun, Rudula and Grmej), making Maslinica one of the most wonderful spots in the Adriatic. The beauty of the surrounding nature is in harmony with the historical, architectural and environmental values of the old castle and picturesque stone houses. The settlement developed around the castle built by the noble family Marchi in 1708. Due to frequent pirate attacks, the Marchi brothers requested from the Venetian governor an approval to build a castle with a tower to defend the village. The family populated their estate with farmworkers from the regions of Dalmatian Zagora and Herzegovina, who were also engaged in fishing and seafaring. The family also commissioned the building of the church of St. Nicholas, located on the highest hill south of the bay. Upon restoration of the castle and construction of a marina, the once small fishermen''svillage gradually grew into a tourist and nautical centre of the island, welcoming more and more tourists and repeat guests each year. A 300-year-old castle is now a carefully refurbished heritage hotel offering individually designed luxury suites, with a helideck and an exquisite restaurant. This is a great tourist destination for the lovers of the nature, unspoilt beaches and the crystal clear sea, lately becoming increasingly popular with cyclists, rowers, yachtsmen and divers, as well as with the aficionados of recreational fishing and hunting. Adventurous tourists will surely go for a jet-ski ride, while those who prefer basking in the sun will go to the beautiful pebble beach or take a trip to the nearby Šipkova Bay and be pleasantly surprised to find a sandy beach there, the only one on the island! Kayaking to one of the islets is also a good idea - the view of the nearby bays, Trogir and Drvenik,from the Parish Church of St. Nicholas, is quite rewarding, but we are sure that the view of the sun setting behind the islets scattered in the sea like gems will leave you breathless! Those who prefer to stay on the coast can explore the biking/hiking trail connecting Maslinica with Donje Selo and Srednje Selo. You can also visit the nearby Šešula Bay, whose geographical position and deeply-indented coastline make it a safe mooring site. There you can try local specialties for a unique gastronomic experience. In 2012 Maslinica received a national award for the best tourist destination in the Adriatic with less than a thousand inhabitants, as an acknowledgment of its intact natural beauty and tourist achievements and in 2017 Maslinica recived nacional award as the best Authentic Coastal Destination! Nečujam It is located in the biggest bay on Šolta and is the island''s youngest settlement, gravitating towards the central beach overlooked by a large apartment resort, owing to which Nečujam used to be one of the most famous destinations on the Adriatic coast before the 1990-ies. Its tranquillity and green vistas inspired some of Croatia's greatest poets, namely Marko Marulić and Petar Hektorović. The house where Marko Marulić was staying still stands in the very centre of the village. Many consider Nečujam the most beautiful bay of the island of Šolta. It comprises eight coves: Bok Supetra, Šumpjivina, Podkamenica, Maslinica, Tiha, Bok od rata, Piškera and Supetar. The construction of contemporary weekend houses and a tourist resort has turned Nečujam into a modern tourist destination; however, one thing has remained unchanged through the centuries: its name. Its Latin name Vallissurda or the Deaf Bay stems from the very size of the Nečujam bay, where any sound gets muffled and turned into a whisper. Beautiful beaches on both sides of the bay and in the coves, and a long seafront promenade will enchant you any time of the year. The best option in the hot summer days is to find refreshment in the translucent, crystal clear sea and take a rest in the shadow of a pine wood. The astonishing nature is what makes this place a true paradise. Marko Marulić described Nečujam with the following lyrics: ""You know I live on an island, not too far away, Just nine miles away from the town. And if my friends wish to keep me company, Or savour this blissful countryside peace,"
212,Šolta,In less than seven hours,"A boat will bring them here, where I dwell alone."" Rogač Its development can be traced way back to the ancient times, when it was built as a port for the island's most important settlement, Grohote. Even today it is Šolta's central port and a starting point for an adventurous exploration of the island. At the time of ferry arrivals and departures, Rogač is packed with guests and islanders hurrying to reach their destinations, especially in the summer. Thanks to its amazing nature, beaches, central position and excellent road access, Rogač has become a destination of its own. It is an ideal choice if you wish to explore the entire island and be surrounded by exquisite beaches with crystal clear sea, nature, peace and quiet."
212,Šolta,Srednje Selo,"Today the smallest and the least populated settlement, it was oncea home to farmers, olive and vine growers who farmed the land in Šoltansko polje stretching below. Stone houses clinging one to another and the now abandoned village school witness the times when far more people lived here. Similar to other Šolta''s settlements, its irregular stone-paved alleys form a number of dwelling units, among which Purtića dvor and Lukin dvor stand out for their remarkable environmental value Unfortunately, many interesting examples of vernacular architecture are dilapidated or have even fallen into ruin, so a thorough restoration of the abandoned and decayed houses is needed in order to preserve the original settlement. Nevertheless, the village has a certain charm. Make use of a sunny day and take a walk or the biking trail from Grohote to Srednje Selo, pass through Donje Selo and go all the way to Maslinica."
212,Šolta,Hidden beaches and coves,"Šolta is an island yet to be discovered - its southern bays are a true gem and a must-see! The more or less indented,turquoise oases are ideal for single day excursions, exploration adventures, bathing, swimming, fishing, etc. As soon as you move away from the shore, you will be stunned by the powerful, dark blue open sea that can take you to the nearby islands of Vis and Hvar. Šolta's southern part is a true treasure for boaters, hikers, inquisitive souls, islanders... On the route from Maslinica in the south-west, all the way to the other end of the island,i.e.to the capes close to the island of Brač and Livka Bay in the south-east, one can find a number of hidden coves alongside the entire southern side. The series continues on the northern side of Šolta, too."
212,Šolta,Tatinja Bay,"An ideal place for a day's excursion and a quiet rest. It has a few small beaches, and it is heaven forcliff divers. The tranquil, crystal clear turquoise sea is protected against both northern and south-eastern winds. In the midst of the bay protrude two rocks, reminiscent of two islets. You can reach the bay on foot from Grohote - by macadam path, and by bike. If you choose to visit it by boat, it is useful to know that the anchorage is at the depth of 5-10 m. Jorja Bay is the next closest bay."
212,Šolta,Jorja Bay,"It boasts a small pebble beach and is perfect for a swim. Given the quite large anchorage area, the best way to get there is by boat.It offers an equally stunning view both on arrival and departure. In-between these two bays, at an altitude of 64 m, lie the remains of the prehistoric fortress Gradine."
212,Šolta,Senjska Bay,"Another magical southern bay that can be reached on foot by macadam path from GornjeSelo. Enjoy the peace and quiet while bathing in the crystal clear sea! No wonder the Illyrian queenTeuta liked it so much that she had a fortress (called Gradac) built on the Mir Hill in Senjska, as testified by the remains. Legend says that anytime the fishermenwould have a great catch, they would throw fish towards all four cornersof the world for even better luck next time. Stračinska Bay When descending towards the bay on foot or by bike from GornjeSelo, an incredible view will present itself before you, perfect for a great photo once you climb your way up through the thick pine woods. The bay hosts a few small rental houses located on the beach - a true turquoise paradise! A few scattered boats, sprinkled like salt over the still water surface in the summer days. If you go left, you will get to the beach Maložalo, while Veložalo is on the right. The bay also has a small, hidden, white-pebble beach with an interesting name ""Di dida pere guzicu"" (""Where Grandpa Washes His Bottom""). Once you get there, you will spot the stone image that says it all!It is perfect for a multi-day stay on the boat. The anchorage is at the depth of some 7m, but the bay is not perfectly safe for anchoring during 'jugo' blasts. The same gulf hosts the Sajtija Bay with a few houses; the sea here is incredibly translucent and clear, offering a stunning view of the island of Vis from in-between the two bays."
212,Šolta,Livka,"It is located near the Split Gates and is closest to the island of Brač. You can reach it by macadam path from Gornje Selo, and some of its outer parts by car, too. In its vicinity is Cape Bad,where you can rent a secluded house and enjoy the beauty in peace. The anchorage is at the depth of 10 m. Because of the boats passing through the Split Gates, it can get quite wavy during the day. The bay is not safe for boaters when southern winds blow. Gornja Krušica Below Vela Straža, the highest point of the island, lies Gornja Krušica surrounded by thick pine woods reflecting in the sea. It can be reached on foot from GornjeSelo or by road or sea from Stomorska. This emerald-sapphire oasis is heaven for swimmers, tourists, inhabitants and boaters. Once a small fishermen's village with old stone houses, it has to date kept its old charm, and the newly built houses offering private accommodation have not in the least bit spoilt its appearance and peacefulness. It is precisely this combination that makes it so appealing. There are no restaurants or shops in the village, so if you choose to spend your vacation in an apartment or a house in GornjaKrušica, you will truly enjoy the peaceful ambience, the sun and the sea. Donja Krušica It can be reached by a narrow road from Donje Selo, by car, by bike or on foot. Once you have reached this beautiful bay, you can enjoy bathing in the crystal clear sea. The bay offers a typical Mediterranean scenery - old stone houses right by the waterfront and numerous small boats. It is ideal for all those who wish to enjoy a peaceful summer; you will immediately feel like you have entered a scene from an old Dalmatian postcard."
212,Šolta,Donje Selo,"Pay a short visit to the village on your way from Grohote to Maslinica or vice versa. Stroll through its stone-paved alleys and discover its secret corners. Today, it has an air of loveliness and simplicity due to a considerable number of stone houses restored for holiday renting. We suggest you to go for a walk or ride along the biking trail,an alternative route to Maslinica, starting from Grohote and passing through Srednje Selo and Donje Selo. There is also a tiny road leading from the village to the beautiful bay of Donja Krušica. Its inhabitants once made a living from fishing and farming. Today, they are mainly focused on producing olive oil and wine, while fishing became a hobby. With an increasing interest in tourism, Donja Krušica is gradually becoming a tourist destination that attracts more and more tourists each year. The settlement dates back from the period of Antiquity. Numerous archaeological finds, such as the remains of a villa rustica, the walls of a rectangular building with a floor mosaic, discovered on the upland of Gradine, ancient stone mounds and graves, and the remains of the foundations of the early Christian church of St. Jela from the 6th century testify to the old times. The first historical records of the settlement date back to the beginning of the 16th century. Here you can find the churches of St. Martin and St. Jela. The Parish Church of St. Martin is an old cemetery church that has seen several refurbishments over the years. The inhabitants of Donje Selo have preserved a long tradition of venerating St. Martin. Archaeologists have found a record titled 'The Letter of St. Martin, Bishop of the City of Tours', of unknown age, which has been preserved owing to a pastor's transcript from the 19th century. The veneration of St. Martin on the island represents a valuable part of the related cross-European cultural heritage. The 'Foot of St. Martin' was attached to the Confraternity House in Donje Selo on 3 July 2010 to mark Šolta's joining the European Cultural Route 'Saint Martin of Tours'."
212,Šolta,Gornje Selo,"It is a typical example of the Mediterranean architecture, protectively overlooking the rest of the island. The architectural integrity of the village with the church bell tower dominates all views, even when looking from the sea, i.e. from the Vis Channel, reflecting its environmental value. Owing to a fertile land and the vicinity of bays on the southern side, farming, vine- and olive growing, and fishing have always been the main occupations. Today, when walking through this hamlet with typical Dalmatian architecture, you can findhouses restored to their original state, typical Dalmatian taverns and the essential part of the local tourist offer - family farms and an oil mill, where you can treat your palate to the award-winning flavours of oil, wine, olives and herbs turned into liqueurs. Do not hesitate to take a walk, explore and enjoy the village!"
212,Šolta,Grohote,"Šolta's oldest and largest settlement has always been the economic and administrative centre of the island, despite the fact that its inhabitants were mostly lime-burners, farmers and fishermen. Municipal offices, a post office, a clinic with a helideck, a pharmacy, a volunteer fire department and a police station are among Grohote's major public facilities. The very centre boasts narrow, irregular alleys that close the residential buildings into partially separated units with atriums and taverns, and give away the old rustic Mediterranean charm that no one who walks through its stone alleys can resist. These old and invaluable architectural gems contribute to the authenticity of the island setting, and this is why all reconstruction works are planned in a way to preserve its traditional architectural values. A number of scenes from the famous Croatian TV series Velo misto, filmed mostly in Grohote, give a true presentation of the island lifestyle. Some of the widely acclaimed island painters like Eugen Buktenica, Marin Kalajzić, Dinko Sule and Vicko Buktenica grew up in these narrow alleys."

Educational Trail at Pavičić Family Farm - Injatički Brijeg In the area of the City of Grubišno Polje, an educational trail called Injatički Brijeg has been established as part of the existing Pavičić Family Farm (OPG Pavičić Ivana). The farm was founded in 2018 with the goal of engaging in tourism through accommodation facilities, receiving funds for the construction of two apartments and the development of the educational trail. The trail is located in the eastern part of Grubišno Polje and is connected to the plots and plantations of the Pavičić farm, which are nearby and separated by the Injatica stream. A pedestrian bridge has been built over the stream to provide safe access to the trail. At the entrance to the trail, a wooden gateway marks the beginning of the educational path. The forest in which the trail is built is mostly deciduous, with the central part planted with coniferous trees that are currently in poor condition, with plans for replanting through specific activities. The trail itself is bordered by wooden logs laid on the ground, and the area between the logs will be cleared to make walking easier. Outside the trail, the forest will remain as undisturbed as possible."
213,Southern Bilogora,Sacred heritage,"Church of St. Joseph in Grubišno Polje In the heart of Grubišno Polje, the Roman Catholic parish church of St. Joseph stands as a dignified witness to history. Not much is known about the church's history, but records mention a Catholic parish before the Turkish invasions of the 15th and 16th centuries. Grubišno Polje (referred to as ""de Grobozyncz"") is documented as a parish with a priest in 1495, and the name of the priest, Mihael, is recorded in 1501. After the Turkish withdrawal, the settlement of Grubišno Polje was scattered and far from major roads. Empress and Queen Maria Theresa (1740-1780), as part of her reforms, ordered the construction of houses along the road to Virovitica. In this spirit, the Catholic church was built in 1782 in the center of the settlement and was dedicated to St. Joseph as its patron. St. Joseph is the patron saint of the Church, fathers, husbands, carpenters, woodworkers, and all workers, craftsmen, and the dying."
213,Southern Bilogora,Church of All Saints in Veliki Zdenci,"The youngest parish in the Grubišno Polje area is the All Saints Parish in Veliki and Mali Zdenci. It is located in the very center of Veliki Zdenci and is easy to find no matter which direction you come from. The parish was established in 1993 by Cardinal Franjo Kuharić. After the completion of major construction work on the local parish church, which was overseen by Fr. Josip Žagar and Imbro Valjak, the church was blessed in November 2014 by the Bishop of Bjelovar-Križevci, Msgr. Vjekoslav Huzjak. In October 2015, Bishop Huzjak also blessed the new church bells. Interestingly, Croatian National Television (HTV) broadcast a Mass from the Church of All Saints in Veliki Zdenci as part of its religious programming. This took place on October 11, 2020, during the Sunday of Thanksgiving for God's blessings."
213,Southern Bilogora,Parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Ivanovo Selo,"The Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Ivanovo Selo was built in 1945 during the tenure of Fr. Josip Klenovšek. In 2009, the church's bell tower was completed, and a new fourth bell was installed that same year. Parish Church of the Holy Spirit in Veliki Grđevac In the late Middle Ages, Veliki Grđevac served as the center of both civil and ecclesiastical parishes, with records mentioning it as early as 1334 and 1501. After the devastation brought by the Turks, the parish was reestablished in 1789. The parish residence was built in 1827, and a large parish church dedicated to the Holy Spirit was constructed in 1832/33. The church's architecture reflects the styles of late Baroque and Classicism. In the long-standing tradition of religious life in the Parish of the Holy Spirit in Veliki Grđevac, the year 2011 marked a significant historical milestone. It became a notable entry in the annals of not only the local church but also the Catholic Church in Croatia and the entire Croatian nation. The Catholic Church in Croatia was enriched by the beatification of five women, known as the Drina Martyrs, one of whom, Blessed Terezija Bernadeta Banja, was a native of this parish. Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene in Donja Kovačica The filial chapel of St. Mary Magdalene in Donja Kovačica is a wooden structure dating back to 1763. The chapel is home to a remarkable and valuable iconostasis, with an inscription on the Marian icon dating from 1724, created by the Russian painter Grigorije Gerasimov-Moskoviter. The iconostasis features icons of Christ and the Blessed Virgin, St. John the Baptist, and St. Nicholas, painted by Gerasimov-Moskoviter, while other icons were added in 1769 by the local painter I. Bratanović. The Restoration Institute in Zagreb proactively restored the chapel's roof by installing new shingles. Some of the icons have been restored and are temporarily housed in a church museum in Zagreb. The icons of Christ and the Virgin, along with three Apostles, are being stored in the church in Velika Pisanica until their restoration is complete. Once the restoration is finished, all the icons will be returned to the iconostasis in Donja Kovačica. The Ministry of Culture in Zagreb has included this chapel in the register of cultural heritage, recognizing its historical and artistic significance. Parish Church of St. Demetrius in Mali Grđevac The Parish Church of St. Demetrius in Mali Grđevac was built in 1760. Until 1932, it belonged to the Parish of Velika Pisanica. In that year, it was declared a parish church when a new parish was established with its seat in Mali Grđevac. A wooden church with a ""foundation"" is mentioned as early as 1796, which was later replaced by the current masonry church. The original church possessed a significant collection of valuable icons, likely from the old wooden church. Due to age and damage from woodworms, these icons have been conserved in recent decades. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991-1995), the church suffered severe damage: the iconostasis was destroyed, the church furniture was ruined, and the bells were damaged and taken. Local Church of Gornja Kovačica In the early 1930s, the first missionaries preached in the Bilogora region, and groups gathered in private homes for weekly worship services. This highlighted the need for a dedicated place of worship. Encouraged by the Church administration from Zagreb, a church building was constructed in Gornja Kovačica in 1951, at house number 75. This was largely funded by voluntary contributions from the faithful and was built on private family land due to difficulties in obtaining a construction permit at that time. Due to the deterioration of the church in Gornja Kovačica, which is part of the Daruvar Church District, services have not been held there for several years. Instead, parishioners gather at churches in Daruvar and Grubišno Polje. Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene in Donja Kovačica The filial Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene in Donja Kovačica is a wooden structure dating back to 1763. Its iconostasis features an exceptionally beautiful and valuable icon of the Mother of God from 1724, painted by the Russian artist Grigoriy Gerasimov-Moskoviter. The iconostasis also includes icons of Christ, the Mother of God, St. John the Baptist, and St. Nicholas. Additional icons were painted by the local artist I. Bratanović in 1769. The Restoration Institute in Zagreb has proactively undertaken the restoration of the chapel's roof by installing new shingles. Some of the icons have been restored and are temporarily housed in the church museum in Zagreb. The icons of Christ and the Mother of God, three Apostles, and other icons are currently stored in the church in Velika Pisanica until they can be fully restored. Upon completion of the restoration, all the icons will be returned to the iconostasis in Donja Kovačica. The Ministry of Culture in Zagreb has listed the chapel in Donja Kovačica in the Register of Cultural Heritage. Seventh-day Adventist Church in Grubišno Polje The first Adventists in Grubišno Polje are mentioned as early as 1908, with the formation of the first community in 1930, which initially gathered in private homes. Eighteen years later, the first formal congregation was established as a church. In 1986, a new church building was constructed on Ivana Nepomuka Jemeršića Street. This building was renovated and expanded in 2012 with the assistance of the City of Grubišno Polje. Additionally, there are religious facilities in the settlement of Turčević Polje. The Adventists in Grubišno Polje are part of the Daruvar Deanery. A large number of members of the Christian Seventh-day Adventist Church regularly participate in Saturday religious services in Grubišno Polje. The pastor of the Christian Seventh-day Adventist Church in Grubišno Polje is Dejan Vučetić."
213,Southern Bilogora,Evangelical Church in Veliki Zdenci,"The Evangelical Church located in Veliki Zdenci serves a congregation of over fifty members from Veliki Zdenci, Mali Zdenci, and surrounding areas. After World War II, the predominantly Czech-speaking faithful gathered in private homes for Bible reading and hymn singing. The spiritual revival of the Evangelicals in Veliki Zdenci began in 1990 with the arrival of missionaries from Finland, Seija Uimonen and Rajli Tapio. This marked the start of renewed efforts in spiritual education and outreach to children and youth. In 1995, a new church building was consecrated, funded through donations from Finland and Germany, as well as the voluntary labor of the congregation. The church was dedicated by the late Bishop Vladislav Deuch of the Evangelical Church. The church is open to everyone regardless of nationality or religious affiliation. Services are held every Sunday at 11 a.m., with Bible study on Wednesdays at 6 p.m., confirmation classes on Fridays at 6 p.m., and youth meetings on Saturdays at 7 p.m. The church is located at Zdenački gaj 21, Veliki Zdenci."
213,Southern Bilogora,Church of the Nativity of the Holy Mother of God,"The Church of the Nativity of the Holy Mother of God is located in Mali Zdenci. This Orthodox church was built in 1761 using the cantilever construction technique with a shingle roof, which links it to the tradition of folk architecture. It is a single-nave chapel with a rectangular floor plan, featuring a semicircular apse of equal width and a rectangular narthex that is higher and wider than the nave, with a bell tower positioned above it."
213,Southern Bilogora,Convent of the Sisters of Charity,"The Convent of the Sisters of Charity was listed as a preventive protected cultural heritage site of the Republic of Croatia in 2005 and is considered one of the most significant cultural and historical landmarks in the city. Inside the building is the community of the Sisters of Charity and a memorial room dedicated to Father Ivan Nepomuk Jemeršić, who was instrumental in the arrival of the Sisters of Charity in Grubišno Polje. Today, the Sisters are active in the parish of St. Joseph and at the Ivana Nepomuka Jemeršić Primary School. Initially, in 1939, the Sisters ran a kindergarten and a school for handicrafts. However, after 1945, due to the challenging historical period, the Sisters ceased operating the school and kindergarten and have since focused on their work at St. Joseph's Parish, where they continue to serve as organists, catechists, and sacristans. Church of St. George the Great Martyr The Church of St. George the Great Martyr is located in Grubišno Polje. The first Orthodox settlers arrived in Grubišno Polje after the Peace of Sremski Karlovci, at the beginning of the 18th century. By 1732, Grubišno Polje and its surroundings had 135 Orthodox households. Later, in 1755, Grubišno Polje itself had 50 Orthodox households, the Church of St. George, and two priests. The Orthodox population in Grubišno Polje grew until the mid-World War II, when it began to gradually decline. The large masonry church of St. George in Grubišno Polje was constructed between 1773 and 1775. The Illyrian Court Deputation informed Metropolitan Jovan Đorđević that the Empress had permitted the construction of a new church because the old one was prone to collapsing and was situated far from the village. To this day, the church stands along the road leading to Virovitica in relatively poor condition, but restoration work is underway. In the Orthodox cemetery in Grubišno Polje, there was a chapel dedicated to Emperor Constantine and Empress Helena. Currently, only the churchyard remains, as the building was destroyed during World War II."

214,Welcome to Split,Welcome to Split,"The story of Split began when Roman Emperor Diocletian decided to build a palace for his retirement days here, on a peninsula close to the great Roman city of Salona. Many centuries later, that palace and the city that was born within its walls was to become part of UNESCO's World Heritage List."
214,Welcome to Split,Marjan hill - In Search of Soul of Split,"Marjan, the hill that overlooks the city has always been the most impressive part of Split imagery. Such a harmony between natural and urban is rarely found; on one side the densely populated city in all of its glory and on the other a peninsula of almost pristine nature. Holy hill, as it is often called, harbors many monuments of sacred and secular architecture which are combined with this green oasis in such a way that they inspire a sense or awe an admiration even in a passer-by. The very fact that we climb up to Marjan directly from beautiful and world renowned waterfront of Split („Riva"") gives the visitors from any part of the world a chance to experience the beauty of this park-forest, the freshness of air and stunning view of the city of Split and the nearby islands from several unique lookout points. Marjan offers to its visitors peace and tranquility, recreation and entertainment with natural pathways and trim-trails. Some would say that there wouldn't be Split, if there wasn't Diocletian. However, would there be a Diocletian's Palace if there wasn't scenery that attracted retired Roman emperor to build his Palace here? No matter which direction the one is coming from, this small - barely 180 meters high - green hill is a main orientation point. However, Marjan is more than just a nature. On its eastern slopes the first out-of-Palace neighbourhoods were created. Dozens of Marjan small churches and chapels - or records about ancient Greek or Roman temples - witness a millennial spirituality. In early 20th century Marjan became a unique public recreational space through forestation, and construction of kilometres of paths, stairs and viewing points all around. Writing about Marjan is writing about Split history, its spirit and its people, who find their peace in its woods, or paths, or beaches. Recently it's been also discovered by tourists, as a proof of simple tourism industry rule: guests always enjoy same things or places that locals enjoy. Enjoying Marjan is possible in so many ways. Literally only minutes from traffic, noise and city fuss you can let yourself float in a silence, completely preserved nature and - yes - spirituality. Just watch what locals do, and follow their steps. Hiking, biking, climbing, jogging, sightseeing, or just enjoying in a view is possible pretty much year round, even if it's raining you can find a beauty. When weather allows, there is also swimming, kayaking, or just plain sunbathing. How to do it? There are guides, there are guidebooks available, several agencies are doing tours, or offer different activities, but why not do it by yourself? One of the possible ways is to stroll from one small church to another, and on your way discover all the Marjan's secrets. This map will help you. One of the possible tours begins at the church and monastery of Saint Francis at Riva. From there go uphill through a labyrinth-like Veli Varoš, and stop at the viewpoint with the most photographed view on Split, and the old Jewish cemetery founded at 1573. From there, proceed to a 13-century church of Saint Nicholas, with another spectacular view, including Sustipan peninsula with Saint Stephen church where Croatian kings were coronated. Take the gravel road westbound, overlooking southern slopes of Marjan, and nearby islands, enjoy among other things a view to Ivan Meštrović's Kaštilac and church of Our Lady of Good Advise. Further to the west is Our Lady of Bethlehem, built in the 14th century, and then one of the Marjan most precious jewels, the 15th century church of Saint Jerome, protector of Dalmatia, with hermits' caves above, and cliffs popular among frfee climbers. Right under Saint Jerome lies Our Lady of Seven Sorrows. From there you can either go back to city centre, or just continue around. At Marjan's western-most point is Saint George, walking further takes you to remains of Saint Benedict, and nearby recreational area. Walk back to Veli Varoš, and find four more pearls - Saint Manda, miniature Saint Mikula (Dalmatian form of name Nicholas), even smaller Our Lady of Soca, and the parish church Saint Cross. Just walking from one to another will give you an opportunity for some serious exercise, if enjoying in this historic and spiritual stroll is not enough. Split, A Running Paradise Recent Split Marathon was a huge success, thousands of people took part in this celebration of running, some of them on full size marathon, much more for half marathon. Once again, Split was sporting capital of Croatia, and there is nothing to say but to wish them many, many years of this wonderful event. Results are available on Marathon's web site, but even more important is that Split is now marked on world running map, as a place which gives a lot of opportunities for possibly the most massive sport. Those who will see videos from the race will see that there are many places where you can run. Every running fan can find a right route, depending on preferences - flat, uphill, trail, by the sea, hills. Just name it, Split has it all. Plus, with a climate like we have it in Split, running is possible almost year round. Obvious choice is, as usual, Marjan Forest park. The most popular track is its ""ground floor"", as we sometime call it. It's paved road going around the hill, with some mild uphill and downhill. You won't be alone there, because most of local runners use that route. Just be careful with bicycle traffic on the northern side, and vehicles with a permit on the southern side. It's safe, but still don't run in a wrong lane. If that option is too flat, go uphill. Paved road takes you all the way to the top, at 178 meters altitude, with rewarding 360-degrees view from Telegrin terrace. For example, you can start at the northern gate of the forest park, run around the hill, and then go up to Telegrin, followed by downhill back to the gate. On the map, this circle would look like this. You prefer trail running? No problem, Marjan offers that, too.You prefer trail running? No problem, Marjan offers that, too. Just take any forest path from the road, and wander around the park, you can't get lost, as long as you remember which direction is the sea. Recently Marjan went through some heavy forest works, with many trees recently taken down because of bark eater infection, but most of paths there are open and safe. And don't forget the cherry on top: swimming spots are everywhere around Marjan, perfect to cool down after running, or as part of triathlon practice. For those who like cardio challenges, there is a Skalinada - route going up the stairs from the waterfront, all the way up to Telegrin. In total, more than 800 stairs to run, depending on whether the one would take any detours, especially around Old Jewish Cemetery. Local record from the race called Marjanska Skalinada (always in Easter season) is 7 minutes 40 seconds. On the opposite side of town, there is a perfect running route just by the sea. You can start just outside city port, and then pass by some of popular local beaches, from Bačvice to Duilovo. In total, it's about five kilometres of running. No uphill, just flat, paved surface, and you can dive into the sea whenever you want. Who can ask for more?"
214,Welcome to Split,A Medieval City in a Roman Palace,"When Split's historical centre was inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List, the main reason was the excellent preservation of Diocletian's Palace. However, almost equally important for such an honour was the fact that people had lived within the walls of the palace, continually, from ancient times till today. The greater part of this heritage, which spans over 1700 years, was created in an era we usually call the Middle Ages, although it includes the Renaissance era too. The appearance of Diocletian's Palace, as we see it today, dates largely from those centuries. Parts of the buildings from the Roman-era disappeared, during later contruction work, and the original layout of the palace, which was based on military camp, has turned into a chaotic but charming labyrinth of alleys. In addition, the imperial mausoleum was turned into the cathedral, Jupiter's Temple was converted into a baptistery, and churches were built above all four gates. Some of them still exist, such as the bell tower above the western gate (aka Iron Gate), which is over 1000 years old. Even better preserved is the Church of Saint Martin above the northern gate (aka Golden Gate). Unless you know it's there, you can easily miss this medieval jewel from the 6th or 7th century. But if you enter it, it will give you a completely different perspective, overlooking the centuries-old rooftops of old Split."
214,Welcome to Split,Beaches for Dogs,"Dog owners know how hard it can be for their pets to endure hot summer days - it's not just a coincidence that we use the term ""dog days"". Of course, beaches are not the only place where dogs can have fun and exercise. Split has plenty of parks, notably Marjan forest park with its endless paths to explore. While people can always find relief in the sea, with a cold drink at a cafe, or in an air-conditioned room, what about dogs? Of course, for better or worse, they normally share the fate of their owners. In Split, they can do this when it comes to swimming, too. Still, wherever you go with your dog, bare in mind the basic rule: respect others so they will respect you too."
214,Welcome to Split,Beaches with Accessibility,"Split pays a lot of attention to people with disabilities, and tries to make the city as accessible as possible to wheelchair users. What about beaches? There are several spots where wheelchair ramps and other aids afford easy access into the sea. And some beaches are accessible due to their natural features. Understandably, there are some limitations caused by the layout of the historic centre, especially within Diocletian's Palace. Here some areas are less accessible due to steps and old stone slab paving. The situation is similar in some parts of Marjan forest park. On the other hand, most street intersections have ramps for easier access, and important parts of the old town, such as promenades, are completely flat and unobstructed. Some museums, theatres and other establishments are accessible too, as are some shopping malls. Public transport is also well adapted for wheelchair users. In the old town, two elevators offer an alternative to steps. Several public toilets have a cubicle designed especially for those with disabilities. Parking spaces for the disabled are marked, and vehicles without disability stickers are prohibited from parking there."
214,Welcome to Split,Cathedral in Imperial Mausoleum,"When Diocletian died in his palace in the heart of today's Split, he was laid to rest in an imposing mausoleum. It's a massive octagonal structure, with a circular interior plan, rimmed by a series of columns, which were connected to the mausoleum by a roof, creating a covered walkway around the main building. A few hundred years later, in the mid-7th century, this grand tomb built to celebrate the emperor was converted into a cathedral. Today, it's one of the oldest buildings in the world still active as a cathedral that combines antique pagan and medieval Christian heritage. The imperial sarcophagus, made of red porphyry, once stood there but was later destroyed. Today, in its place, there are altars with reliquaries of the patron saints of Split, Domnius (loc. Duje) and Anastasius (loc. Anastazije or Staš), who were executed in nearby Salona during Diocletian's reign. The mausoleum was covered by a dome, which was probably decorated with mosaics, and on its lower edge was a wreath, decorated with mythological creatures and reliefs of human heads. Among others, two of the surviving medallions depict portraits of Diocletian and his wife Prisca, the last trace of their presence in the palace they built."
214,Welcome to Split,City of Art and Culture,"Some of Croatia's most important artists lived and worked in Split, and left their mark here, in a city where culture has always been a key element. Split's cultural heritage is visible on every corner as well as in its museums. After all, isn't Split one big museum, with Diocletian's Palace as its star exhibit? Important artworks can be seen in the cathedral, and the basement halls of the palace often host exhibitions and theatre performances. Architecture, fine art, theatre and film - all these intertwine on Split's streets and squares, in the city's museums and other cultural institutions. Many things are not visible immediately, such as the important composers and writers who have lived or still live in Split. In fact, the father of Croatian literature, Marko Marulić, was born, and lived and worked in Split. Perhaps the most important is the Archaeological Museum https://www.armus.hr/ with an impressive collection of ancient Greek and Roman finds. There is also the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments https://www.mhas-split.hr/ that preserves the history of Croats in the region. The history of Split is told in the Split City Museum https://www.mgs.hr/, which also manages the basement halls of Diocletian's Palace. You can find out more about how daily life once looked at the Ethnographical Museum http://www.etnografski-muzej-split.hr/. Just outside the old town, our rich maritime heritage is preserved at the Croatian Maritime Museum https://www.hpms.hr/ May Sudamja Be Good For You! This centuries old celebration, locally known as Sudamja, takes place on May 7, but whole week before and days after the big day are filled with events which will bring you local spirit and traditions. Those days Split lives on its streets and squares, honouring its biggest holiday and local heritage. Some say that Split wouldn't exist if it weren't for Diocletian. But would there have been Diocletian's Palace if the retired Roman emperor hadn't been drawn to the landscape where he built his residence? If you want to join, and feel like a local, here are some of festivities'' highlights. Since Sudamja is originally a religious holiday, there are daily masses in Saint Domnius' Cathedral."
214,Welcome to Split,Welcome to the city of Diocletian,"Roman Emperor Diocletian, and he is the one we are talking about, is completely real, and unbreakably bonded with the city which was founded within his retirement palace. Diocletian Palace is one of the best preserved monuments of the Roman architecture in the world. The Emperor''s Palace was built as a combination of a luxury villa - summer house and a Roman military camp (castrum), divided into four parts with two main streets. Southern part of the Palace was, in this scheme, intended for the Emperor''s apartment and appropriate governmental and religious ceremonies, while the north part was for the Imperial guard - the military, servants, storage etc. The Palace is a rectangular building (approximately 215 x 180 meters) with four large towers at the corners, doors on each of the four sides and four small towers on the walls. The lower part of the walls has no openings, while the upper floor is open with a monumental porch on the south and halls with grand arch windows on the other three sides. Over the centuries the Palace inhabitants, and later also the citizens of Split adapted parts of the palace for their own requirements, thus the inside buildings as well as the exterior walls with the towers significantly changed the original appearance, but the outlines of the Imperial Palace are still very visible. The Diocletian Palace Substructures represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world, and hence are in many ways responsible for the reason the historical core of Split was in 1979 included on the UNESCO'S World Heritage list. In the Roman times, their function was to elevate the Emperor's chambers on the floor above, but they were also the storage area for the Palace. Being structurally a faithful replica of the chambers above, they enable a faithful reconstruction of the way the Emperor's chambers looked like.In the early Middle Ages a part of them was used as a residential area, and in one of the halls parts of an ancient oil and wine press (turnjačica) were found, remaining exhibited in the same spot to this day The entrance to the halls of the Substructures today is through Porta Aenea, from the Riva, or down the stairs from the Peristyle. Today the Substructures are full of life. They regularly host painting and sculpture exhibitions, theatre plays, fairs like the International Flower Fair, gastronomic and oenological presentations, and many other social and cultural events. The central hall, representing the main communication line between the Riva and the Peristyle, is a place to buy valuable souvenirs, and the rest of the Substructures is open for sightseeing as one of the greatest attractions of Split, frequently, besides Peristyle, a synonym for Diocletian Palace. Peristyle, as the central square of the Palace, intended for the Emperor Diocletian celebrated as the living son of Jupiter, finds its place among many temples. The Emperor would appear under the architrave of the central part of Protyron, and his subjects would approach him, kneeling down, kissing the hem of his scarlet cloak, or they would fall in front of him, their entire body to the ground.The red colour of the granite columns emphasises the ceremonial function. Diocletian's Palace In 1979, the historical centre of Split, including Diocletian's Palace, was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List for two main reasons. Although born as an ordinary farmer's son, Diocletian came to power in 284 AD, after a glorious military career. As shown by reconstructions of the original, Diocletian's Palace was indeed a fortress. Still today, Diocletian's Palace stands as a reminder of the greatness of the Roman Empire, as well as the impressive history of Split. Firstly, Roman Emperor Diocletian's retirement palace is one of the best-preserved Roman imperial residences in the world. Secondly, the palace has been inhabited continuously since 305 AD, leaving a series of layers to recount the history of Split. He made various reforms to improve the already declining Roman Empire, including the implementation of the Tetrarchy (the division of the empire into four parts, each with a different ruler) and the recovery of the economy and the military. He also established the principle that no ruler should hold power for more than 20 years. Indeed, 21 years after being proclaimed Emperor by his soldiers, Diocletian left his capital, Nicomedia, and arrived at the newly-built fortress near the Dalmatian metropolis of Salona. An earlier settlement, called Aspalathos, used to exist there, but Diocletian's retirement home overwhelmed everything. The structure was surrounded by four strong walls, with defensive towers at each corner and next to the gates. It was an impressive structure covering almost 35000 square meters. Considering the level of technology in the late third century, it is remarkable that it was built in just ten years. The palace was divided into three main parts, following the standard principles of late Roman residential architecture. The southern section, with the front wall opening onto the sea with an arcade, accommodated the imperial residence. We can only guess how it was laid out, following the plan of the basement cellars below. The central part was intended for religious and ceremonial buildings, surrounding the marvellous square known as the peristil (peristyle). These included the imperial mausoleum and the temples of Jupiter, Venus and Cybelle. The latter two no longer exist, while the mausoleum and Jupiter's temple were converted into the cathedral and the baptistery. North of the peristyle and the intersection of the two main streets (the Decumanus and the Cardo), resided the imperial guard, servants and slaves. The palace was a symbol of the greatness of both Diocletian and his empire, with treasures brought from its outlying regions, ranging from Greek columns to Egyptian sphinxes. It had just one purpose, to celebrate the grandeur of its ruler. Walking through the city centre is like travelling through time, from antiquity to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, right up to the modern day. Split invites exploration, but be prepared for surprises. Wherever you look, you will find traces of heritage, various influences left by rulers and invaders, as well as by generations of local citizens who have contributed to building their city. And even in places where the palace no longer looks as it once did, its spirit remains. It's the heart of the city, which was born within these walls. Diocletian's Palace Basement Halls In the early Middle Ages, part of the basement, notably in its eastern wing, was inhabited, but most of those residences were removed during reconstruction. In one of the halls, parts of an olive oil press were found and are now on display. However, in the early Middle Ages, when newer residences were built within the palace walls, the basement became a dumping ground for rubbish and rubble, which was deposited there for centuries. Although the existence of the basement was no secret, it was mostly buried and inaccessible due to rubble. The first initiatives for clear out the basements came in the late 19th century, but only in the 1950s and 1960s was it finally done. During that period, the whole western wing was cleaned and opened, and sections that had collapsed were reconstructed. Restoration of the eastern wing was completed much later, and it was opened for visits in 1995. Today, the basements can be accessed directly from the riva (seafront promenade) passing through the palace's Bronze Gate, or via stairs from the peristyle. Besides being a first-class historical attraction for 1000's of visitors, the basements host various events, ranging from art exhibitions to theatre performances and gastronomic fairs. In the central hall, the main passageway from the riva to the peristyle, you can buy souvenirs and artworks. The basements have become especially popular in recent years, as some key scenes from the ""Game of Thrones"" were filmed here, featuring Meereen, Queen Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons. The central hall is the only part of the basement which can be visited free of charge. To see the rest of the substructures, tickets are available at the box office in the west wing, and are valid for the entire space. Working hours depend on the season - the schedule is available via the Split City Museum website. Admission for adults is 8,00 €, or 6,00 € for students and children. Admission is free for children under the age of seven. The family (parents with children under 15 years old) ticket is 16,00 €. Ideally, you should visit the basements with an expert tour guide. However, if you visit alone, excellent information panels have recently been erected, explaining why the basements were built and what they were used for."
214,Welcome to Split,Horse Riding in Split,"Besides all the other activities available in Split, there is also horse riding. It looks like something from a film set, with its vertical cliffs, which were created when gravel was dug out of the quarry. Not many people would expect this in a place known for its sea, beaches and cultural heritage, but it's becoming increasingly popular. Horse riding is usually associated with the Dalmatian hinterland, especially the area around Sinj. However, even at the coast, horses have always been important companions to people. Naturally, it's hard to expect that you might ride a horse around town. However, only about 20 minutes from the city centre there is an abandoned quarry in the suburban village of Žrnovnica https://goo.gl/maps/gjBrfA4RxrunkFrH8. The Game of Thrones producers realized this, and used it to film several important scenes of Queen Daenerys arriving in Meereen. Today, the Dalmatia Equino horse riding club is based there, offering riding lessons. It's also possible to rent a horse to ride. One option is to ride within the club's outdoor school, away from traffic and noise. Much more interesting and challenging is cross country trekking. The route runs around Perun hill, where the quarry is situated, and all the way to the picturesque village Gornja Podstrana. Žrnovnica and the surrounding area are undiscovered local gems. It's an excellent starting point for various outdoor activities - cycling and hiking on Mosor Mountain and around the Poljica region, or walking, picnics and fine dining by the River Žrnovnica, as well as newer offers, such as horse riding or golf on the small golf course by the mouth of the river. And all that, so close to the city."
214,Welcome to Split,Kayaking Around Split,"Probably the most beautiful view of Split is from the sea, no matter from which direction you approach the city and the peninsula upon which it is situated. Of course, safety is important for anyone who decides to embark on such an adventure. Anyone travelling to or from Split by ferry can confirm this, as well as those aboard big or small cruise ships, or sailing boats or yachts. However, Split's location allows for another rare experience; you can tour around almost the whole city by sea. You can take a short excursion along the shore, or rent a boat. More adventurous types might take a step closer to nature, and paddle around in a kayak or a similar vessel. Never paddle in the city port or in places where big ships pass. Don't go too far from the shore, and always, but always check the weather forecast before going out. Wear sun cream and bring plenty of water. The agencies that provide such trips know all these things, as it's their job to secure everything, so guests can enjoy themselves. And exploring Split's coast is very enjoyable indeed, but the best part of all is around Marjan, a forest park and local green oasis. It's a beautiful tour, to depart from Bene cove or Spinut marina, and then sail along the coast, clad with pinewoods, watching the green and blue combination of the sea and trees. You'll follow the cliffs and beaches, all the way along Marjan's southern coast, eventually reaching the waters beneath Sustipan park. Along the way, you'll be able to enjoy historical heritage, too, from the little churches of Marjan to Ivan Meštrović's Kaštilac. Agencies that organize such excursions usually provide all you might need; boats, waterproof containers for your possessions, and a guide who will tell you about the places you can see on your way. They also often arrange transfers to and from the starting point of the trip. Kayaks are not the only adventure activity in Marjan's waters. There are also stand-up paddle boards (SUP's), rock climbing up the cliffs that rise directly from the sea, swimming, snorkelling and rock diving. Later, you can go up onto Marjan hill, either on foot or by bike. This hill, an important symbol of Split, is a perfect spot to escape to nature, only minutes from the city centre."
214,Welcome to Split,Marjan - Soul of Split,"Recently, Marjan has been enriched with new features, such as new paths for runners and walkers, mountain biking trails, playgrounds for children, educational spaces, climbing areas and promenades. Visiting the little churches on Marjan is also a special experience. Start at Saint Francis at the western end of the Riva (seafront promenade). Then take a walk up through Veli Varoš, to visit the 16th-century Jewish cemetery and the churches of Saint Nicholas, Our Lady of Bethlehem, Saint Jerome with the hermits' caves from the 15th-century, and Our Lady of Seven Sorrows with prayers written on its walls. Those churches are scattered all over Marjan, and they show how important Marjan has always been to the people of Split and their spirituality. Probably this is why there is a custom of holding midnight mass at 16:00 on Christmas Eve at Our Lady of Bethlehem. On your way around Marjan, enjoy the views in all directions. You'll see Split, Kaštela, the islands of Brač, Šolta and Čiovo, and further out Hvar and Vis. You can also visit several museums on Marjan, such as the Meštrović Gallery and the Museum of Croatian Archaeological Monuments. In fact, no story about Split can be told without Marjan. Even before Diocletian built his palace, the ancient Romans knew how magical Marjan is. So somewhere near the west end of the peninsular, they built a temple to Diana, goddess of the moon, hunting and nature. That temple was marked on Peutinger's map of the Roman Empire from the 4th-century, making it the oldest written record of Split."
214,Welcome to Split,Riva - Centre of the Centre of the World,"The riva, as everyone in Split calls this strip, is the city's living room, its most important public space. built his palace in today's Split, in front of it was a small port. The importance of the riva for locals is clear at all times of day, and through all the seasons of the year. Still, it's most obvious on sunny days, when it looks like a solar energy station. Its mission impossible to find a free chair at a cafe on those days. The riva is a sanctuary even in the winter, because no other spot in town offers such good protection from the cold north-east wind, the bura. Even on those cold days, the sunshine brings people outdoors, to meet other people. This is the spot where everything important happens, where we grow up, live and meet people. A place where you can hear all the news, where we celebrate victories. Yes, it's also the biggest street fashion show in town. And so it has been ever since the riva has existed. The peer was later extended and became much bigger and wider. But the riva as it looks today is thanks to Napoleon Bonaparte. When the French emperor conquered Dalmatia in the late 18th century, his governor Marshal Marmont demolished the Venetian fortifications and dumped all the rubble into the sea, creating the western part of the promenade- Since then not much has changed. Except 100 years ago, the asphalt and palm trees arrived. About 60 years ago, the riva was widened, and 40 years ago, traffic was banned from the riva. Finally, in 2007 the most recent renovation project was completed. The official name also changed several time, but in Split nobody ever called it anything other than the ""Riva"". When it's time to celebrate New Year, everyone in Split comes to the riva. When a local athlete achieves a sporting success, there will be a celebration on the riva. Every important guest must cross the riva. There's a plaque there, saying that Sigmund Freud stayed in a house on the riva on one of his trips. And Agatha Christie spent part of her honeymoon at Hotel Bellevue at the western end of the riva. Even when it comes to rising up against some injustice, the people of Split will protest on the riva. Guests in Split love the riva because of the significance it has for local people. There, perhaps more than anywhere else, you can feel the pulse of Split. Besides, the riva is the starting and finishing point of any walk around the old town, as all the streets in the old town lead there. Actually, if we accept Split's notorious self-esteem and admit that Split is the centre of the world, then the riva is the centre of the centre of the world."
214,Welcome to Split,Spend a Day like a Local in Split,"Every town or city has its own rituals, those little things known only to people who live there. Why would Split be an exception? A few extra loops around the centre and maybe a stroll along the riva (seafront promenade) have an important function: It's important to immediately face the key local question: what's the weather like outside? No matter who is in charge of cooking, everyone should walk through the open-air market (pazar) or the fish market (peškarija). So, how can you live like a Splićanin (a person from Split, or originating from Split), at least for a day? Sure enough, the phrase ""any cafe"" should be taken conditionally. Viewed from the outside, life in Split looks very casual. As if everything is easier in this mild climate, by the sea, surrounded by monuments and world-class heritage. In such a paradise, you can only enjoy life. Of course, it's not really like that, but there is something we can call the Split way of life. And yes, there is also a Split state of mind. To see who is out on the same ""mission"", what the news is in town, and whether the weather is about the change. All this is important in Split. And the most important thing is to meet people. There are tour guides who get good reviews because they say ""hi"" to someone every five minutes during the tour. It's a clear sign of how much someone is identified with in their city. However, the central ritual is coffee drinking. In Split, as in most of the Mediterranean, it's way more than just consuming a hot beverage. When someone suggests ""let's go for coffee"" you can drink whatever you want, because this is a ritual, an invitation to socialize. So, if you want to look like a local, sit on any cafe terrace and order coffee. Better still, do it in company. It's important to immediately face the key local question: what's the weather like outside? Many decisions depend on that, for example, where you will have coffee. The only thing which doesn't depend on the weather is wearing sunglasses. They must always be either on your head or in your pocket, just in case. You should wear them everywhere, and pretty much all the time, except when going for a swim. That's not done in Split. If you wear sunglasses in the sea, everyone will say, ""that's a tourist"". He weather is also an extremely important topic of conversation. A journalist from Manchester once wrote that he had never met anyone who talks so much about the weather as ""Splićani"". Maybe even Hajduk football club is less important. If you buy something, fine. If not, never mind, it's important to see what's there. These places are the essence of the Mediterranean way of life and inseparable from Split. Where did certain fruit or vegetables come from? What fish is on offer today, and is it fresh? Have prices gone up? These are almost crucial issues. Even if you don't buy anything, you'll have something to talk about over coffee. If you're a guest or a tourist, you don't have to bother with things like going to work. Thus, you can focus on the more pleasant aspects of life. When you wake up, your first thought should be ""I'm going to town"". Yes, you're already in town, but in Split, ""town"" refers exclusively to the centre, meaning Diocletian's Palace and several nearby neighbourhoods. Everything else is ""beyond reach"", or locally ""vanka ruke"". There are several degrees of adjustment. The first level is to have a place where you tend to meet the same people to share important information with or just have a casual chat. The second level would be to sit, and the waiter brings your coffee exactly the way you like it. To be more precise, you have your coffee prepared in a particular way - it's not unusual when a group of people sit together, that no two coffees are the same. That's reason enough to have huge respect for waiters and waitresses in Split - there is no software that can memorize as many variations as they can. In the end, you just want to spend time in a place where there are people, to sit and observe life around you. Only then will you become part of that life. And when you achieve that, you've reached master level. Then, sitting at a cafe or on the riva (seafront promenade), occasionally sigh and say ""this is priceless"" (practice in Croatian - ""ko ovo može platit"")."
214,Welcome to Split,Split - City of Sport,"Besides all of its history, heritage and beauty, Split has yet another thing to be proud of. Its sport. For a long time, Split has been acknowledged as Croatia's sportiest city. With our usual local modesty, we would add it is the sportiest city in the world and its surroundings. However, not even that long list of success is final."
214,Welcome to Split,Split also has Hajduk FC,"The story begins in London in 1948, and will probably never end. Many sports now played in Croatia had their beginnings in Split, and there are countless clubs and individuals from Split who have won numerous titles, ranging from national championships to Olympic medals. You don't need to read old newspapers or dig through archives to check that. It's enough to take a stroll along the western waterfront promenade, to read the names of Olympic medallists who were born in Split, or who played for teams or clubs from Split. We should add those who have never had a chance to participate in the Olympics, such as world-famous alpinist Stipe Božić. There are also those who have won other titles, such as Jugoplastika (today Split), the best basketball team of the 20th century outside the NBA. a unique club that is much more than just a sport, it has become a sort of local religion. In the 110 years since it was founded, Hajduk has always been an important part of the local community, sharing the fate of its city and its residents, in both the good moments and the bad. The history of Hajduk is magnificent, not only regarding the sport itself. Operettas have been composed in its honour, books have been written, and it was a symbol of the struggle against evil during the Second World War. The history of Hajduk is the history of Split in the 20th century. Thus, no matter how successful the club is in any particular moment, no matter how many titles it has won, everybody in Split knows one thing: Hajduk lives forever. After the recent Olympic Games in Tokyo, there are no less than 83 names. Split as a city has one of the highest concentrations of Olympic champions per capita in the world. Soon, the names of equally deserving medal winners at the Paralympics and Deaflympics will be added. Basketball, football, athletics, rowing, water polo, sailing, handball, swimming and tennis - all these are sports in which athletes from Split have spread the glory of their city and their nation. That's why we proudly remember them, by commemorating their names in one of the most popular spots in town. Split, Nautical Paradise And Split is one of its crown jewels. Not just because one of the biggest marinas on the Adriatic is located in Split. The main reason is that Split is an excellent base, or starting point, for exploring the Dalmatian islands, among the most beautiful parts of the Adriatic. Split lies at the centre of the Adriatic coast. So it's easy to sail around the islands of Šolta, Brač, Hvar, Vis and Lastovo, as well as the southern pearls such as Korčula and Pelješac, or the Kornati in the north. Arriving in Split from the sea, or sailing out of it, is quite spectacular, with the view of the city and the Dalmatian mountains behind it. In addition, Split can offer much more than smaller towns. That makes it a fascinating sailing destination, on a coast that has turned Croatia into a super power of world nautical tourism. That's why many crews make a stopover in Split, even if it's not the starting or finishing point of their voyage. The big ACI Marin in the city harbour offers all the necessary infrastructure to confirm Split as an important nautical centre. Numerous yacht charter agencies offer a wide choice of boats to suit everyone's wishes and abilities, either with or without a skipper. There are also repair shops, as well as suppliers ranging from fuel to food and drinks, offering a far wider choice than the smaller ports. Of course, an important element is that it is so easy to reach Split, with its international airport, ferries from the islands and Italy, as well as road and train connections. Therefore, in the immediate vicinity of Split, there are several more marinas, whose guests inevitably gravitate towards Split itself, either before or after sailing. By far the main sector of the nautical tourism industry is the rental of yachts and sailing boats, but everything we have mentioned also contributes to the attractiveness of Split as either a starting or finishing port for small luxurious Adriatic cruises. It's completely understandable, because there are not many other places in Croatia where it's so easy to reach your ship or to stay in a local hotel and explore the city. There are also day trips to nearby destinations, such as the islets around Trogir and the extremely  popular Blue Cave and the island of Hvar."
214,Welcome to Split,Split on Two Wheels,"Despite being very hilly, Split is becoming increasingly popular among cyclists. In fact, riding on two wheels has become one of the most popular forms of recreation here. So it makes sense that tourists are also discovering the charms and challenges of cycling in and around Split. Naturally, one should be careful in traffic, but there are more and more spaces where you can safely enjoy cycling, either in nature or along road routes. The reward is often a spectacular view from a hilltop. One of the results of such popularity is the increased number of specialized agencies that rent out bicycles by the hour or by the day. Alternatively, there are public stations with both regular bikes and electric bikes, available through a simple mobile app - these bikes can either be returned to where they came from, or left at another station. Bicycles with child bike seats are also available. Cycling helps reduce traffic, especially in the city centre. Since large parts of the historical centre are pedestrian zones, you should be attentive and careful of walkers. Around Split, both inland and on the islands, there are lots of options for road and mountain biking, but even within the city limits, there are good places for cycling. The easiest and the most obvious choice is Marjan, a hill and forest park near the city centre. Only a few minutes from the riva (seafront promenade) there are dozens of kilometres of routes, both on asphalt and along unpaved forest paths. Recently trails for more adventurous cyclists have also been added. Marjan forest park offers opportunities for everyone, whether you like hill-climbing or flat routes. Here it is important not to disturb runners, walkers and climbers who come to Marjan for their share of healthy exercise. Cycling is the also an excellent way to reach beaches around Marjan, and wherever you go you'll have beautiful views of Split and the surrounding area. Besides Marjan, you can enjoy riding by the sea, east of the city port, especially on the promenade leading towards Žnjan beach. As some of the most popular beaches lie along this route, you should beware of pedestrians, even on marked bike paths. Just out of town there are even more options, especially for higher-level cyclists. Large parts of Mosor Mountain are within the city limits, and asphalted roads there can be an excellent challenge for lovers of uphill cycling. From there, it's easy to explore even further, towards nearby towns along the coast or in the hinterland. On the city outskirts, there are parking lots where you can leave vehicles used to transport bikes, so you can avoid riding through dense traffic. The mouth of the River Žrnovnica is a good starting point for going into the hills, either by road or along unpaved forest tracks. The most popular routes are towards the villages of Sitno Donje and Sitno Gornje, or to Srinjine and Tugare. One of the biggest challenges is the ascent to the Zvjezdano selo astronomical observatory, above Dubrava. Don't forget the usual precautions. Don't attempt routes above your physical ability, bring plenty of water, notify someone about your plans, and if possible do not ride alone. Routes are easy to find, as they are increasingly available online, through the sites of local Tourist Boards, or specialized portals and rental agency websites."
214,Welcome to Split,Feel and taste Split,"Small things make a city. They make it unique, and make its citizens love it. It''s a reason good enough to make visitors discover all those things which will allow them to love some place in a way those who live there love it. Split has Diocletian''s Palace, it has Marjan, beautiful sea and coast, it has history. Thus, people who live at the spot so strongly filled with heritage become part of the same heritage, and heritage becomes part of your everyday life. But there is more. If there is anything worth of being considered as the foundation of Split daily life, it''s city green market and fish market. Or, as any local would call it, pazar (pron. similar as bazaar, but with the """"p"""") and peškarija (pron. peshkahrya, similar to Italian pescheria). Those two city spots have almost sacred importance in the Split's collective life. Maybe you will find cheaper food in supermarkets, possibly even more diverse, but buying it there will left out an element so important to experience spirit of Split or any other Mediterranean city - a personal contact. That's exactly why those two places are so important for Split inhabitants. And also important to discover the sheer essence of Split as a city. Opportunity to buy fresh and natural food at peškarija and pazar is added value, bonus. After all, there are other places you can do the same, even better. What you can do only there is to have your ""own"" salesperson that will know you by name and always have a piece ""just for you"". What you can do only there is to meet friends, exchange all the novices, or at least find out what she or he is cooking today. What you can do only there is to breath with this city. Swimming in Split: Top 5 Beaches 1. Trstenik beach This pebbled beach is not completely natural, but is well equipped with sunbeds and parasols. Still, there are not too many of them, so you can easily come there and put your towel wherever you want. There is a VIP platform operated by the hotel, but the rest of the beach is completely open for public. Beach is clean, with some bars around. Water is very clear, mostly because it's open for currents, and if you need bigger company, over crowded Žnjan is just around the corner. 2. Bačvice If you want privacy at the beach, avoid Bačvice (pron. Batchweetseh). If you want to meet people, this is the first choice. It's the central city beach, popular among locals and young tourists looking for some fun. It's a sandy beach, with sunbeds and parasols (maybe too many of them, but they are usually all taken). For people in Split, Bačvice is part of their city's identity, and if you see some guys (and sometime girls) running around and jumping while trying to hit small ball with a palm, it's picigin. This beach game was born here, because solid sandy seabed is perfect for short sprints and parades. It's also probably the only beach game protected as a cultural heritage. Bačvice lives 24/7 during the season, because many bars and clubs are one of the biggest nightlife zones in town, including Split Beach Festival. Sea water is surprisingly clear, for beach with so many people. 3. Kaštelet Only about twenty minute seaside walking from the city centre, you will reach pebbled beach just below the Ivan Meštrović Gallery, and southern slopes of Marjan Hill. Main population on this beach is twenty-something crowd, families are usually based little bit away. Water is clear, it's not populated as Bačvice, and there are bars right on the beach if your really can't stand being thirsty. Of course, if you don't like loud music while swimming you will go somewhere else. This is also good spot to meet local people. 4. Kašjuni It might look difficult to pronounce, but here it is: """"kahshyounee"""". It's another Marjan beach, with position close to perfect. You can reach it on foot (not recommended in the middle of summer), by public bus number 12, by car, by bicycle. You can come there straight from town, or from the Marjan Hill, as a refreshment after hiking or jogging, or whatever you do for exercise. Get in the water, look up, and you will see Marjan Hill in its full beauty, with pine forest, churches, rocks, etc. Water is fine, especially if you swimm away from the beach. There are some beach amenities, like lounge bar or seabeds, and more is yet to come. Very close is also the Split's only, and unofficial nude beach. 5. Bene We are still at Marjan Hill, on the beach which is part of recreational centre in the pine forest at the northwestern part of this popular forest park. There are several tennis courts, football (or soccer) field, playgrounds for children, and even open-air gym. Also, there are kayak tours starting from that spot. You can reach it by bus, but also walk through the woods, or rent a bike and go there like most locals do. Bene is popular among families, especially with children. Water is not as clear like on other beaches in this selection, but mostly because of the sandy sea-bed, not because it's polluted in any way. There is a bar and a restaurant right next to the beach, and in case you like some privacy, area around Bene - named after church of Saint Benedict that once stood there - is full of solitary spots."
214,Welcome to Split,Swimming in Split,"If we start from the eastern part of Split, one shouldn't miss Trstenik and Žnjan. The central part of Trstenik is under the concession of the Radisson Blu Hotel, but it's not limited to its guests. In many ways, this is the best-maintained beach in Split, with fine pebbles, sunbeds and umbrellas, and a beach bar. Plus, there's a VIP zone on a wooden platform. The sea is very clean at Trstenik, not only on the Radisson beach but also elsewhere, where you can also find showers. If you want to meet more people, the much busier Žnjan beach is literally around the corner."
214,Welcome to Split,Welcome to Antiquity,"There are few cities in the world that can be so strongly associated with one person, in the way that Split is associated with Roman Emperor Diocletian. When he built his retirement palace, he also created the plan of the future city. That's why we return to him so often. You can do this by taking a tour of Diocletian's Palace with a licensed guide and exploring its 1700-year-old heritage, or by joining a tour through an agency or online platform. Strolling through the streets of Split will take you back through the city's history and the layers that created it. You can try to imagine what Diocletian's Palace looked like when it was first built in 305 AD, when the former Emperor was seeking privacy close to his birthplace following his abdication from the throne. Besides searching for pictures of the reconstruction of the palace, probably the most popular way is a leap into virtual reality at Diocletian's Dream. You can hang out with Roman soldiers on the streets of Split, and bring home a photo souvenir. Our guys in legionaries' uniforms will do everything to amuse you, with performance with swords and spears."
214,Welcome to Split,Christmas fair in Split,"1. Christmas fair at Riva This is the central point of Advent in Split, with recognizable cottages offering food, drink and souvenirs. 2. City park (Djardin) New Advent location is one of the most beautiful spots in town, park next to the Gregory of Nin statue and Diocletian's Palace's northern wall. Stage next to the 19th century fountain will offer some classical music, choirs, etc. In short, more serene and quieter experience than noisy and sometime hectic Riva. 3. Advent at Piazza If you still remember 70s and 80s, and music of that era, you will love it. And there is one special day to spend it there, but more about it in the next paragraph. 4. New Year's Afternoon You can celebrate New Year as everyone else, with open air concert and party at Riva. However, Split is a little bit peculiar place. There is no better way to describe a town with a church where Christmas Midnight Mass is celebrated at 4 pm. Same goes with New Year, you shouldn't miss to party at Piazza on December 31, and to celebrate New Year at 3 pm, like it's midnight. All ingredients are there; snow, music, sparkling wine, drinks, food, good company. 5. Weather OK, it's winter time so don't expect spending time on a beach (except for those people from number 6). It can be cold, with some serious wind, and even rain. However, chances are that at least part of Advent time we will have clear sky, temperatures around and over 10, in short - suitable to sit outside. 6. Picigin on Christmas and New Year Yes, there are people who dare to get wet on a beach on these days, in 12-13 degrees Celsius water temperature. If you are not among them, put on some jacket, and head to Bačvice beach on Christmas and New Year''s Day to watch one of local traditions, people playing beach game picigin in shallow waters. 7. Codfish and fritule There are two treats which are always part of holidays season in Split and Dalmatia. We maybe don''t cook codfish in as many ways as Portuguese, but in this part of the year it''s served everywhere. Best would be to find some new or old friends and enjoy it at someone''s home, but any restaurant will do. Same goes with fritule, small fried dough balls, usually with raisins. There is no better than get some homemade, but don''t hesitate to use any opportunity to have them. 8. City mood What is usually called tourist season ended a couple of months ago, but by the end of the year the whole city looks like someone turned a switch on. In some cases it can be even more alive than in the summer, like on some locations I mentioned before. Even beyond those hot spots, it might be a problem to find a chair in bars and restaurants, or public space big enough for all those who want to have fun. 9. Public klapa singing One of the most recognizable elements of Dalmatian tradition is klapa, special a capella way of singing. It''s not unusual to hear groups singing around, but it''s something really special on day before Christmas, and on December 31. If you are in town those two days, don''t miss to come in the western or Iron gate of the Diocletian''s Palace and listen spontaneous choir singing. This is what it sounds and looks like. 10. Celebrate like locals If you really enjoyed most of those previously mentioned things, than we must congratulate you. You are qualified to be declared ""Splićanin"" (someone living or originating in Split), which is a very special title in a very special town. Join us and celebrate like we always do."
214,Welcome to Split,Five Reasons to Visit Split in Spring,"In springtime, Split offers true magic of travel and experience where you will find yourself enjoying in the sun, nature and spring food specialties with many outdoor events. Here are five reasons why springtime in Split is so special. Now you don''t have any excuse not to come. 1. Weather After winter season filled with rain and cold wind, starting from the end of March Split will be bathed in sun and look as we love it the most. Of course, winter in Split is not really polar, it can be even pleasant. However, this is something completely different. And then the whole city life is different, when every street corner is sunbathed, and daily life moves to open spaces. 2. Food We know that Split is not unique when it comes to all culinary joys that warm weather can bring. Yet, I can hardly think of any other more pleasant experience than browsing around green or fish market in spring. We have our own springtime specialties, just go to a market and look for wild asparagus, green onion, artichokes, young peas or fava beans. You are tourist and have no place to cook? Don't worry; restaurants in Split are truly loyal to those local gems. Experience will be even richer when you realize you can eat outdoor. 3. Nature Let's go back to number one for a second, because it's necessary to enjoy spring in full lungs. Walk around town, discover its hidden corners, or even better walk, cycle or jog around Marjan hill and forest park. If you are more ambitious, you can go hiking on nearby mountains. Don't tell anyone, but you can even find some wild asparagus there. And then, sometime in early May dare to swim on some of many beaches in Split. They will be just right, without sea of bodies lying around. Sometime you will feel like those places are there just for you. 4. Mafic of pre-season In the last few years Split is the fastest growing tourist centre in Croatia, with annual double-digit rise. That can be an obstacle for someone who wants to get familiar with any town, to blend with its life. Therefore, this is the right time to enjoy in magic Split can offer without endless lines of tourists. Sit and sip a glass of wine on ancient squares, eat without long waiting for an available table. In short, become """"Splićanin"""" (local name for a person who lives in Split) those few days while you are with us. 5. Travelling If you want really to enjoy in our number four, you need to reach Split. Even that is easier in spring. Sometime in late March many season flights opens to and from Split, from most of European countries. Even if you don't like flying and prefer driving, it's much easier in pleasant weather."
214,Welcome to Split,Events,"Advent: Winter Joys by the Sea Of course, children are not forgotten, and there are plenty of festivities for them, especially in Strossmayer Park, locally known as Djardin. Here, the traditional ice-skating rink creates a ""White Christmas"" atmosphere. Children can meet some of their favourite characters, such as those from fairy tales, or Saint Nicholas and Saint Lucia - every child in Dalmatia eagerly awaits the presents they will bring. As the patron saint of seamen, Saint Nicholas is especially important in Dalmatia. There is also a tradition of special festive events at the Croatian National Theatre, with performances of ""The Nutcracker"" ballet, and the well-attended Christmas and New Year's concerts. Christmas is celebrated more or less the same way almost everywhere in the Christian world. But local customs are what make the difference. That applies particularly to gastronomic traditions, and there are plenty of them in Split. One is especially important, and Dalmatia shares it with almost the whole Mediterranean. It's bakalar, dried codfish. Despite the wide selection of fish living in the Adriatic Sea and elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the most popular fish during pre-Christmas fasting comes from thousands of kilometres away, in northern Europe. The connection was established in the 16th century, when the church condemned the greed and debauchery of the era. To please God but still enjoy themselves, the rich found a solution to fasting. Dried cod tastes good and looks ugly, so it doesn't draw attention to itself. Very soon, the new custom spread around Europe. Dried cod arrived in Dalmatia from Italy in the 19th century, and soon became one of the symbols of the Christmas season. Another Christmas-related treat is fritule - fried balls of dough with raisins. It's hard to say where you can get the best ones, because everyone in Split will claim that nobody can make them as well as his or her mother at home. Split also has a unique church ceremony. On Christmas Eve, if you walk to the old church of Our Lady of Bethlehem on Marjan, you can attend ""midnight mass"" at 4 pm in the afternoon. There is a simple reason: This way, believers maintain the ancient tradition of a pilgrimage to Marjan. Afterwards, they have enough time to return home and spend Christmas Eve with their families. If given the chance, don't miss it. Another place to be on Christmas Eve, and also on New Year's Eve, is the Iron Gate in Diocletian's Palace. At noon you will be able to hear some of the best klapa singers, masters of traditional Dalmatian a capella singing. And on Christmas Day itself, as well as seven days late on New Year's Day, take a walk to Bačvice beach. Besides exchanging best wishes with everyone you meet, watch a holiday game of picigin. If you're not brave enough to join the players in the cold sea, put on your coat, sip a drink and enjoy the view. To end, let's return to the beginning: There are winter joys in Split, but you'll need sunglasses to enjoy them."
214,Welcome to Split,Celebrate Domnius and his City,"Split has never been shy about celebrations, but there is nothing we celebrate more fervently than our patron saint, Domnius, on his name day, 7 May. So who was Domnius? The city is so closely connected to this former Bishop from the nearby Roman city of Salona, who was executed during Emperor Diocletian's reign, that people in Split often call him by the familiar version of his name, Duje. In tribute to him, for centuries Duje has been the most popular boy's name in Split. He thus became ""one of us"", despite the fact that he was executed over 1700 years ago. Ironically, Domnius is the patron saint of the city founded by his executor, Emperor Diocletian, and Diocletian's mausoleum was later turned into the cathedral, where Domnius is now buried. In Split, Saint Domnius Day is known as Sudamja (pron. Soodamyah). It was and still is a Christian holiday, but for Split its more than just that, almost like the city's birthday. The central part of the celebration is a procession of the saint's reliquiaries, followed by a mass. However, the secular part of Sudamje is at least equally important, and often begins days earlier, with fairs, concerts, sports and gastronomy events. On the actual day, the morning is reserved for a handcrafts fair, and there is an old custom of buying something made of wood, usually a spoon or some other household utensil. After the procession and mass, a large crowd gathers for the city's tombola, which is more of a social event than the chance to win something. Over the last 10 to 15 years, it has become a custom to hold a big concert in the evening on the Riva (seafront promenade) followed by a fireworks display. He was probably born in today's Syria, and at the time of Diocletian's persecution of he Christians, he was the Bishop of Salona, the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia, located just a few kilometres from Split. Diocletian had him imprisoned in 304 AD, and later executed in the amphitheatre in Salona. He was buried in the Manastirine cemetery, outside the walls of Salona. In the 7th century, when Christianity became the dominant religion and the Roman Empire was long gone, Domnius' remains were transferred to Split, and he was laid to rest in the former imperial mausoleum. Sailing Festival: Mrduja Regatta In Split, football might almost be a religion, but this is also the capital of sailing. One of the things that makes Mrduja so great is that literally anyone with basic sailing skills can participate in a race only 22 nautical miles long, from Split to Mrduja and back. Needless to say, it's always a good idea to have an experienced sailor aboard. All you need is a boat, a group of friends or family members, and a love of socializing and the sea. And, of course, some wind. Both Croatia's Olympic medals for sailing were brought home by a man from Split -  Tonči Stipanović, a member of Mornar Sailing Club, won them in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo. And it's difficult even to count all the medals won by members of Split's sailing clubs at the European and World Championships. Split is the host or starting point of some of the most interesting regattas on the Adriatic. Although some are bigger or more competitive in the sporting sense, one is loved above all: the Mrduja regatta, usually called just Mrduja (pron. Mrhdooyah). Usually held on the first Saturday in October, it sees hundreds of sailing boats of all sizes flock in front of Split's port. Some of have professional crews, but many come to compete out of pure joy and love of the wind and sea. Still, they are all equal participants in this unique sailing festival. The regatta was first organized by Labud Sailing Club in 1927. It's named after a small rock, Mrduja, located in the channel between the islands of Brač and Šolta, just 11 nautical miles from Split. All boats travelling to the islands of Hvar, Korčula or Vis can see it, rising in the middle  of the sea passage. The founder of the Mrduja regatta was Count Toni Pavlović, who won the first race on his boat ""Magima"". Through the decades, Mrduja has grown to what we see today, and turned into a genuine festival of sailing, with thousands taking part in various races over several days. Only one regatta on the Adriatic is bigger - it's the Barcolana regatta in Trieste, Italy, but it has a much shorter history. Naturally, winning is crucial in every race, but in the case of Mrduja, it doesn't necessarily mean winning the race. It's enough to choose someone in the race to compete against in your own ""Little Mrduja"". It can be a family member, a friend, a neighbour, maybe even someone you don't know. All this is yet another story about the spirit of Split. Even if you don't sail, join viewers in Sustipan Park or on the ACI Marina breakwater. The view is spectacular, with hundreds of sails speckling the Adriatic."
214,Welcome to Split,Split Carnival,"There are carnivals in many cities around the world, some of which have long been global attractions. Sometimes, people even travel to a city especially to see its carnival. It seems that humans have a need to free their inhibitions once a year, and indulge in the madness they usually keep under control. So, on Shrove Tuesday become part of Split's traditional festivities, and join the Cukuni (pronounced  Tsoockoonee), guardians of the carnival spirit. Of course, Split also has its carnival. Or krnjeval (pronounced krhnyehval), as we say here. For centuries, on Shrove Tuesday, the day before the beginning of Lent, people in Split have been putting on masks and having fun. And we still do so today. However, don't expect neat and rehearsed parades of masked groups in Split. The spirit of this city is too unrestrained for such a thing. After all, as early as 1688, Bishop Stjepan Cosmi banned priests from taking part in the masquerade. He thought it too wild for the clergy to participate. Some people expect carnivals to be polished, and they might object to the anarchy of Split carnival, but it's just the way it is. On the contrary, it should remain so, instead of being remoulded into a neat organized event. It doesn't matter if you buy a mask or make it yourself, whether it's just a wig or an elaborate silly joke with a group of friends. What matters is to open all the valves, and put all daily troubles behind closed doors. All your worries will disappear in the flames of the bonfire which will destroy Krnje, a symbol of everything bad that happens to each one of us, and society as a whole."
214,Welcome to Split,Split Summer Festival - The City of Theatre,"Summer in Split doesn't mean just partying, swimming and sunbathing. The same goes for drama performances. Split is also a city that offers plenty of cultural and art events. Among them, a special place goes to the Split Summer Festival, one of Croatia's oldest theatre festivals. Every year, from mid-July to mid-August, Split is a stage for top class drama, opera, ballet, concerts and exhibitions. The Festival is organized by the Croatian National Theatre Split  https://www.hnk-split.hr/ , which has been making our city's summers more beautiful ever since 1954. As soon as the regular theatre season ends, all ensembles turn to the production of the Split Summer Festival. This festival focuses on open-air public spaces. The local theatre's productions, as well as notable national and international guests, take over the whole town. Some of these productions have become an inseparable part of city life. That goes particularly for the opera performances on the Peristyle square, in the heart of Diocletian's Palace. Some of the most important works of classical opera shine there, with the backdrop of Roman buildings as the scenography. The highlight of the festival, ""Aida"" by Giuseppe Verdi, goes one step further. The 3,600-years old sphinx, brought to the palace by Diocletian as a war trophy, becomes an important part of the stage. Opera has other stages too - in the theatre, in the Meštrović Gallery and on Marjan. Some of these productions have been talked about for years, and many have won awards too. Some shows are impossible to perform outside of the theatre, but every opportunity to perform in the open-air is seized. Sometimes it's in the historic centre, or in Sustipan Park, or in Meštrović's Kaštilac, or any other space which is suitable for the play, its storyline and its messages. Usually, the most popular plays are ones that talk about the mentality of the people of Split, and the way of life here, both past and present. Ballet has probably the most beautiful setting. Lovers of this art can watch ballet performances in Sustipan Park, high above the sea, with a view of the islands. Combined with the award-winning Split ballet troupe, every performance is a special experience. If we add concerts of classical music, jazz and folklore, plus exhibitions in local galleries and museums, it's clear that this summer art feast is a sufficient reason to visit Split, the City of Theatre."
214,Welcome to Split,Welcome to Antiquity,"There are few cities in the world that can be so strongly associated with one person, in the way that Split is associated with Roman Emperor Diocletian. And soon, when the pandemic passes, we will once again begin holding the Days of Diocletian, an event that takes you on a trip back to antiquity, when Diocletian, his wife Prisca, daughter Valeria, and their soldiers walk the streets of today's Split. When he built his retirement palace, he also created the plan of the future city. That's why we return to him so often. You can do this by taking a tour of Diocletian's Palace with a licensed guide and exploring its 1700-year-old heritage, or by joining a tour through an agency or online platform. Strolling through the streets of Split will take you back through the city's history and the layers that created it. You can try to imagine what Diocletian's Palace looked like when it was first built in 305 AD, when the former Emperor was seeking privacy close to his birthplace following his abdication from the throne. Besides searching for pictures of the reconstruction of the palace, probably the most popular way is a leap into virtual reality at Diocletian's Dream https://www.diocletiansdream.com/. You can hang out with Roman soldiers on the streets of Split, and bring home a photo souvenir. Our guys in legionaries' uniforms will do everything to amuse you, with performance with swords and spears. Once again we will dress in togas and play the game of life in the past, watch gladiators' fights and the parade of imperial legions, and feast on ancient delicacies. Once again, every day at noon, we will watch the changing of the imperial guard on the Peristyle square. The Emperor's ""ave"" will be heard again on the imperial square, welcoming all the travellers who have come here to admire his legacy. There is nothing that can separate Split from its emperor, or Diocletian from his Split."

215,Stara Novalja,Outdoor,"Immersed in an enchanting landscape, we're compelled to pause as the scent of sea and salt revitalizes our spirits. Trekking through the rocky terrain, we venture past quarries and arrive at the Novalja Field, a green oasis contrasting the previously rugged landscape, home to numerous species of wildlife. Moreover, the Novalja Field abounds with potable water, the source of life, a fact recognized by the ancient Romans who, in the 1st century, carved an underground aqueduct measuring 1,100 meters into the living rock, connecting the field to the settlement of Novalja. Dubbed ""Talijanova buža"" or the Roman Aqueduct by locals, it can be explored at the City Museum, offering insight into its ancient architecture and the nine resting places stretching along the Novalja Field, showcasing the significance of this invaluable cultural monument from the era of the Roman Empire. In the Novalja Field, encountering wild animals like rabbits, pheasants, badgers, turtles, or foxes is not uncommon, as they are typical inhabitants of this area. Continuing our stroll surrounded by olive groves, vineyards, and dry-stone walls enclosing cultivated lands with domestic animals, a glance beyond the walls reveals sheep, goats, or poultry. The tour through the Novalja Field leads us back to the starting point near the church of St. Anthony."
215,Stara Novalja,Svetojanj trail,"The Svetojanj trail is exceptionally attractive, yet technically challenging and demanding, offering a unique visual experience with its diverse landscape alternating between rich vegetation and barren rocky terrain. It was named after the prehistoric Byzantine fortress Svetojanj from the 6th century during the reign of Emperor Justinian. The starting point is from the Novalja Field, in front of the church of St. Anthony, situated in a picturesque location above the pond overgrown with tall reeds. On the edge of the pond area, in the shade of tall tree canopies, you can seek refreshment from the spring water source, which dries up in the summer months. Therefore, make sure your mandatory equipment includes at least 1.5 liters of water, grape sugar, fruit, and energy bars, considering the demanding nature and length of the 19 km trail. The trail leads us towards the small coastal village of Stara Novalja, where we join a gravel road. Walking through untouched nature with picturesque vistas, Mediterranean flora intertwines with rocky terrain. The distinctive scent of indigenous plant species and medicinal herbs gradually fades as we approach the Zaglava site, a part of the island known for its exposed bare rock subjected to strong bora winds and sea salt. Due to these conditions, vegetation in this area is almost non-existent, but it will show you why Pag is called the ""moon island."" Here, caution is needed, as the rocky, sunny, and remote area of Zaglava is an ideal habitat for horned vipers, the only venomous snakes on the island."
215,Stara Novalja,The viewpoint,"The viewpoint is designed in a way that its urban equipment tells the story of fishing posts, informs and educates visitors, and encourages the interest of young people in fishing activities. All urban equipment will be made of Brač stone, with high aesthetic value and suitable for outdoor conditions. The project's goal is to acquaint visitors with the fishing posts of Stara Novalja, the coast, their connection to the settlement, as well as to familiarize visitors and residents with fishing methods in the area."
216,Stari Grad,Stari Grad,"Did you know that Stari Grad, a little town on the island of Hvar is the oldest town in Croatia? Some historians claim even in Europe. Conveniently, Stari Grad means old town in Croatian. And indeed the old chap is born the same year as Aristotle, yet it is still very much vital and charming, combining the mystic vibes of ancient times with authentically Mediterranean spirit, all spiced up with the subtle touch of modernity. Who doesn't wish to escape from the hustle and stress of contemporary life, living carefree in harmony with nature? Slowing down becomes a goal for most of us and Stari Grad is just an ideal place for harmonious family retreat in any season and part of the year. This is the place where you will become inspired, regenerated and relaxed.

Srinjo kola (Middle street) is somewhat of a Stari Grad's Monmartre. Picturesque and exciting, the street is an artistic center of the old town. Strolling along this central street will take you to one of the two impressive squares, depending if you turn left or right. One is in front of the parish St Steven's church and the other is called Škor. In summer time both squares become stages, hosing numerous cultural events and concerts. Don't be surprised to hear a cappela sounds coming up from any corner of the town. It's traditional klapa singing that Stari Grad is famous for. Enjoy open air concerts of traditional klapa singers and Dalmatian dances while visiting exciting Cultural summer program in Stari Grad. Stari Grad is a lot but not all about culture. Once you feed your soul it's time to refresh your body. Cycling, swimming, sailing, diving, you name it. Yet, the bike tour though the UNESCO protected Stari Grad Plain is something not to be missed. You will be able to enjoy spectacular natural scenery, witness the best preserved historical field on Mediterranean, meet hard working locals and taste the fruits of their passion and dedication to the soil.

217,Ston,Ston,"Ston is located on a narrow isthmus that connects the Pelješac peninsula with the mainland.

With numerous towers and bastions that are really worth visiting. Just like the walls, you will be delighted by the view of the surrounding southern Dalmatian islands."

217,Ston,Walk along the Ston Walls,"The walls of Ston were built in 1333 when Ston became a part of the Republic of Dubrovnik. Their purpose was to defend the Republic and the peninsula. Dubrovnik government in 1335 and amended in 1370 and is considered one of the best-planned and best-structured cities in Europe. The walls of Ston were a massive architecture and construction feat. Originally 7000 meters long (22 965 ft.), they consist of several parts; the Ston city walls, the Mali Ston city walls, and the Big wall with its three forts.

They are the mines of the treasure collected under the blazing sun, and it is only through hard work that this treasure becomes available and harvestable at one time during the year, making it even more valuable and even more appreciated. Salt. White gold! In the Middle Ages, it was not only a coveted means of payment, but also a cause for wars and for establishing important trade routes. Salt. Food was indispensable for humans and animals to live. The produce without which the history of human aspiration to beauty and better looks is unthinkable. Salt. Gold from the sea. The lands to which nature bestowed position by the sea have also bestowed a fortune at the reach of the hand. This, in the economic life of the Ragusan Republic, too, the production, transport, and trade of salt occupied an extremely important position. The Republic owed a fair share of its prosperity to the production of and trade in this important foodstuff. The saltworks of Ston were a permanent concern of the Republic and its authorities until the dismantling of the Republic in 1808. Such saltworks are, generally, valuable monuments of the economic activity of the people in the past, and being exploited still, they witness the superb continuity of human work under the best of environmental conditions.

The Napoleon Road on Pelješac The Napoleon Road on Pelješac extends from Ston, south-east of Orebić and Viganj, to the north- west of the peninsula. This district route of the French roadway along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea is 61,364 meters long. The strategic importance of the Pelješac route was predestined by the completely inferior position of the French on the Adriatic, during which time their enemy, the English and Russians, governed. The route was constructed in stages and continued so under Austrian rule during which all larger settlements on the peninsula were interlinked. Under the French army, participation by the local inhabitants in carrying out the construction was enforced. Hence there are noticeable differences in the construction methods and quality of the particular road sections. The French route on Pelješac is one of the rare remaining witnesses to the period in the Dubrovnik area. The route was, for strategic reasons, situated so that it often traversed inaccessible mountainous sections, from where there are attractive views, providing a completely new experience of the area.

It is also a testimony of the centuries old connection of the people of Sukošan with the Virgin Mary who protected them during troubled times. The church has inbuilt loop holes which make us conclude that it also served as a protective edifice in front of the town's gate. Interesting are also the door-posts, two pre-Romanesque epistyles. These are reliefs from the 9th and 10th century and are undoubtedly originally from the St. Cassian's Church. There used to be a cemetery around the church."

This is supported by the assumption that the name derived from the name of the San Cassian. Today's appearance received in the year 1642 to be read over the northwest gate, over which is representative of the pediment of the altar wall - the most representative in our medieval art - originated probably in the middle of the 11th century or earlier.

Try the first gin from Brač! THAT EVERYTHING WE SEE AROUND US WAS ONCE AN IDEA is best illustrated by Larisa Hržić, a sociology master who made a rather unusual but creative career move. Enjoying a glass of her favorite spirit - gin, which made a big comeback to the alcohol scene in 2019, this girl joked that she would create a version entirely to her taste. Said and done: 4 years later, after a lot of education - both about the herbs used in its making and about the gin scene itself - the first bottles of this sophisticated spirit with a strong Brač stamp are coming out of the small s778 Heritage distillery! As they have now reached quite far - to Germany, Switzerland, and even distant Canada - an internal joke emerged that global fame apparently awaits it! ATTENTIVE TO EVERY DETAIL. Does the number 778 in the name evoke something special to you, you're not mistaken - it is, in fact, an allusion to the highest peak of the Adriatic (Brač's Vidova gora) at 778 meters above sea level, and that attention was paid to every detail is shown by the letter 's' in front of 778 - it's an indication for sun, sea, stone, or in our translation, for sun, salt, and stone - everything that defines the island. The bottle itself tells the story, so in the visual identity of the gin, its role is also played by the cap made of Brač stone, and the pinnacle is, of course, the taste - besides the mountain juniper that is the foundation of this drink, s778 gin contains a total of eight indigenous island herbs and spices! The best culinary stories are being cooked up in Supetar! Mihaela Vargašević and Vedran Bošković unlock new, exciting taste chapters of Supetar!
