Leoninus and Perotinus, the most famous early composers of organum, wrote their music for performance at the Romanesque and Gothic versions of the Notre Dame Cathedral, respectively. During the Baroque period, quite a few great composers, such as the Italian Jean-Baptiste Lully (''Giovanni Battista Lulli''), the inventor of French opera, as well as a few others such as Marc-Antoine Charpentier and Jean-Philippe Rameau, worked for the royal court in Versailles, now a suburb of Paris. The Baroque period also saw the development of the high tenor, or ''haute-contre'' voice in the heroic roles of French opera, due to the fact the famed castrati who were popular in the rest of the continent never manged to get a foothold in France. Later in the 18th century, several of Haydn's symphonies and other works were performed to great acclaim in Paris, and the French opera tradition continued with composers such as the German Christoph Willibald Gluck, the Italian Antonio Salieri, and the Belgian André Grétry composing many critically acclaimed works.<br>In the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, a long list of famous composers lived and worked in Paris, including the Belgian César Franck, the Frenchmen Hector Berlioz, Jules Massenet, Georges Bizet, Gabriel Fauré, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel and Francis Poulenc, the Italians Gioachino Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi, the Pole Frédéric Chopin (''Fryderyk Szopen'') and the Russians Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev. Several famous organist/composers had regular jobs at churches throughout town, including St. Sulpice and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. The operetta was also invented here by the German composer Jacques Offenbach, whose operetta ''Orphée aux enfers'' (1858) contains a few pieces still instantly recognisable by current-day listeners.<br>The Opéra Garnier is a lovely, historic and iconic building that houses the world-renowned Paris Opera Ballet (''Ballet de l'Opéra de Paris''). The newer Opéra Bastille, widely considered one of the best in the world, houses the Paris Opera (''Opéra National de Paris''), one of the world's premier opera companies. Another significant though less well known venue is the ''Opéra-Comique'', where Bizet's famed opera ''Carmen'' had its premiere in 1875. Paris today has a very varied performance scene and remains vital as a center for new and experimental music, as exemplified by the ongoing work at IRCAM, the Institute for Acoustic/Musical Research and Coordination founded by the recently deceased Modernist composer and conductor, Pierre Boulez, and the Ensemble Intercontemporain, which he also founded."

Dorogozhychi quarter played an important role in the historical destiny of Kyiv. There the fate was solved for many princes pretending to the Kyivan throne on the one hand, and fate of Kyiv itself, on the other hand. Numerous invaders carried out from here their multiple attacks on Kyiv, and Kyivan princes conducted bloody battles with them. Such a strategic importance of this location became one of the reasons for foundation of a monumental church-fortress. In 1139 Vsevolod Olhovych, Prince of Chernigiv approached Dorogozhychi, an important strategic point, on the Kyiv’s north-western outskirts, gained possession of the area and simultaneously obtained a convenient bridgehead at the approaches to Kyiv. In 1140–1146 Vsevolod Olhovych erects St. Cyril’s Church at Dorogozhychi. Construction of a church-fortress is a logical step of Vsevolod as a prince-worrier, and prince-strategist, for the sake of fortifying outskirts of the “capital city” so desired by many. St. Cyril’s monastery is an example of a unique functional combination, because it is a sacred center, patrimonial palace church, and at the same time it is a monumental church-fortress. The church was named after Cyril, the holy hierarch Cyril of Alexandria — Christian patron of the church’s founder, prince Vsevolod Olhovych. - The most precious treasure of the St. Cyril’s Church is its unique '''mural painting'''. - In the 12th century walls of the St. Cyril’s Church were painted in fresco technique according to the Christian iconographic canons of that time. In the 17th century the fresco painting of the Church was partially renewed by means of tempera. In the 1800's, during repair of the Church its walls instead of painting were just plastered and whitewashed. - In the 1880s restoration works were carried out in the Church under the guidance of the professor of St. Petersburg University, A. Prakhov. At that time from under centuries-old layers of plaster and whitewash a unique Old Russian mural painting was discovered. However, soon after, in order to provide the mural painting for “grandeur” the frescoes were refreshed with oil paints. In the 1970s a large-scale restoration works on frescoes’ discovery from under layer of oil paint of the 19th century were carried out. - FRESCO painting: Monumental figures of twelve Apostles are located in window piers of the dome’s drum. Four Evangelists are portrayed on sails (architectural spherical triangles serving for transition from the drum’s cycle to the under-dome square). The representation of the EvangelisMark on the south-estern sail has preserved the best of all.- Central arches supporting the dome’s drum are decorated with images of theSeban Martyrs placedewithin medallions literally interconnected by means of loops and hoops. These representations form as if “alive holy chain” protecting the celestial sphere. In the central apse there is a figure of the Holy Mother, Orans with her hands raised in prayer. Oil painting of the 19th century represents the major part of the composition; of the ancient fresco representation only an edge of the Holy Mother’s blue chiton and a podium on which she is standing have survived. Beneath the Orans the Eucharist fresco composition is located featuring the scene of the Apostles’ holy communion, in which the Christ is depicted twice: at the left He serves the body of Christ (bread) to the group of Apostles headed by the St. Peter, and at the right He serves the blood of Christ (cup of wine) to the group of Apostles headed by St. Paul. Similar plot depicting two figures of Christ is already known in miniature of Rossan Code in Asia Minor dated with the 6th century. According to the canon which can be recognized already in the Church of San-Vitale in Ravenna, in the St. Cyril’s Church the center of the composition represents a double dome on pillars over the throne onwhich a cross, a paten with seven round flat breads, a cup of wine and an asterisk are placed. - '''Belfry''': Of the monastic buildings Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi constructed within the monastery, his most important construction was a free standing belfry, built in 1760. The belfry combined the idea of a tall campanile with a gate on the ground level and a chapel on the belfry's second tier. The two lower levels of the belfry had some elements of a Ukrainian tripartite church, consisting with the belltower placed over the central part of the nave. This architectural combination in a belfry with two apse-like lower elements on each side. The original roof above the belfry's chapel was a stepped-hipped roof, which was popular at the time. After the fire of 1849, the roof's over the chapel and the cupola were modified from the original. After the Ukrainian SSR's decision on the demolition of the belfry in 1936, the belfry was destroyed a year later, to be used as bricks in construction projects."

The Roman Catholics received their parts due almost purely to the Crusaders and, like all Roman Catholic shrines in the Holy Land, the Roman Catholic part is under the custodianship of the Terra Sancta (i.e. Franciscans).  :Parts of the Holy Sepulchre are controlled by several different branches of the Christian Church, who have historically been somewhat at odds with each other. It is important to note that the ""church"" is not one church in the sense of a building with an altar and podium near the front, but rather a ""warehouse"" of churches even for each denomination present: each has several altars and chapels. The Orthodox Church makes up the largest of the churches there and is situated in the center directly to the east and in front of the Sepulcher as well as at Golgatha. The Armenians have several smaller altars and chapels throughout the edifice as well as a fairly large church called ""Saint Helen's"" but often referred to as ""Saint Gregory (the Illuminator of Armenia)."" The Roman Catholics have two chapels, the Ethiopians have one in addition to a monastery on the roof, the Copts have a small altar behind the Sepulchre itself, and there is a small yet beautiful Syriac chapel up some stairs near the Coptic altar, though it is usually closed. There are even what are known as ""ecumenical altars"" set up on the sides in various areas which are apparently almost purely decoration and are rarely if ever used. There are many pathways and exploring here makes for a few hours of fun for those who love religious art and architecture.  :The best time to come is early in the morning and make your way out by 11AM. Even after sundown it is incredibly crowded. Be warned though, if you are wearing shorts, you might be barred access to the building itself but if not, then certainly to individual churches and without a doubt to the sepulchre. Women should have their shoulders covered, no cleavage, and dresses should go below the knee. Do not wear anything which might be considered even the slightest bit risqué. If you do not oblige, they will turn you back.  :Upon entering the church immediately in front of you is a stone slab set in the floor with a pillar at each corner. This is the Stone of Unction on which, it is claimed, Jesus' body was laid and prepared for burial. Turn right and ascend a steep, narrow flight of stairs to what is claimed to be Golgotha. There are altars here marking the location of the crosses on which Jesus and the two thieves were crucified. It is possible to crawl under the left-hand altar and feel a hole in the rock which is said to be the hole in which the cross was placed. Return down the stairs and go underneath Golgotha. A glass panel in the wall shows fractured rock, claimed to have been broken in the earthquake that followed Jesus' death.  :When you come out of this room turn right and follow around the passage. A long flight of stairs leads down to the underground Chapel of the Invention of the Cross (a slightly unfortunate name!) which is the cistern in which St Helena, mother of Constantine, found the True Cross. Note the thousands of small crosses carved into the walls flanking the staircase by Crusader period pilgrims.  :Come back up the stairs and continue round the passage past various chapels that mark the Stations of the Cross. This brings you to the Rotunda, beneath which is the Holy Sepulchre itself. There is usually a queue here as people line up to visit the tomb. The first small room is where the angels sat who announced the resurrection to the women who came to the tomb on Sunday morning. The second, which is a squeeze for three and impossible for four, contains a marble shelf supposed to be the spot where Jesus' body was laid. Photography - even flash photography - is allowed, but one should be discreet and respectful, as others in the room will regard this as the most holy of all sites and their visit to it as the emotional highlight of their pilgrimage.  :Unfortunately the tomb is almost certainly spurious, as 1st century AD tombs had a particular form exemplified by the Tombs of the Prophets on the Mount of Olives (see below). When you come out of the Sepulchre turn left and go round behind it. A low doorway leads into the often dusty and neglected Chapel of St Nicodemus and a further doorway takes you to a small room in the wall of which are genuine 1st century AD kokhim - coffin-shaped tunnels cut into the wall. If the tomb of Christ is anywhere in this building, these are more likely to be it than the official Sepulchre outside."

The facility is located in the center of the city, in the Lenin Comsomol park. With a capacity of 52,518 spectators, the Stadium hosts FC Shakhtar Donetsk matches and hosted some matches of Euro 2012. It is also one of the popular nightlife spots in Donetsk. The initial estimated cost of the project was USD 250m. USD 30m has been allocated to set up a recreational park around the Stadium. The final cost of the project will reach USD 400m. The name of the stadium represents the shortened name for the Donets basin industrial region, hence - Donbas, however the official name in English spells after the Russian orthography. - Construction began in 2006. The general contractor was a Turkish company ENKA. The Stadium was completed and opened in 2009. About 1600 specialists, mainly Turkish, were involved in the construction.Donbass Arena was designed by ArupSport, who also designed the City of Manchester Stadium (Manchester, England), Allianz Arena (Munich, Germany) and the Beijing National Stadium (Beijing, China). The soaring roof effect makes the Stadium resemble a flying saucer. The stadium has an oval shape and a glazed façade and is located near Regional Sport Complex Olimpiyskiy. The roof of the stadium slopes from north to south matching the landscape and contributing to the natural lighting and airing of the pitch. The external lighting makes the Stadium shine at night. -   The Donbass Arena was completed ahead of schedule, but the grand opening was delayed until 29 August 2009 to coincide with the Ukrainian holiday of Miners Day, as well as Donetsk City day. Donetsk is in the Donbass region, a mining region, and the date was chosen for its symbolism. The prime tenants of the facility are named Shakhtar Donetsk (""Donetsk Coal Miners"").American Pop/R&B singer-songwriter Beyoncé Knowles performed a show from her I Am... Tour on the opening night of the new stadium. It was Knowles' first performance in Ukraine. Beyoncé performed her famous hit Halo to honour the memory of Michael Jackson, who would have had his birthday on that day. Many state officials attended the show designed by K-events Filmmaster Group. The opening ceremony was awarded as Event of the Year at the Stadium Business Awards on June 18, 2010 in Dublin. Shakhtar Donetsk's first match at the stadium was a 4–0 victory in a Ukrainian Premier League 2009–10 Round 8 fixture on 27 September 2009 against FC Obolon Kyiv. The first international game took place on November 18, 2009 against Greece, which Ukraine lost 0-1 failing to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup."

This is a suspension bridge that spans the River Danube between Buda and Pest, the western and eastern sides of Budapest, the capital of Hungary. Designed by the English engineer William Tierney Clark, it was the first permanent bridge across the Danube in Budapest, and was opened in 1849. (It is a larger scale version of William Tierney Clark's earlier Marlow Bridge, across the River Thames in Marlow, England.) It is also the oldest permanent bridge on the Danube. It is anchored on the Pest side of the river to Széchenyi (formerly Roosevelt) Square, adjacent to the Gresham Palace and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and on the Buda side to Adam Clark Square, near the Zero Kilometer Stone and the lower end of the Castle Hill Funicular, leading to Buda Castle. The bridge has the name of István Széchenyi, a major supporter of its construction, attached to it, but is most commonly known as the Chain Bridge. At the time of its construction, it was regarded as one of the modern world's engineering wonders. It has asserted an enormous significance in the country's economic, social and cultural life, much as the Brooklyn Bridge has in New York and United States of America. Its decorations made of cast iron, and its construction, radiating calm dignity and balance, have elevated the Chain Bridge to a high stature in Europe. It became a symbol of advancement, national awakening, and the linkage between East and West. - The bridge was opened in 1849, and thus became the first permanent bridge in the Hungarian capital, after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. At the time, its center span of 202 m was one of the largest in the world. The lions at each of the abutments were carved in stone in 1852, by the sculptor, János Marschalkó. They are visibly similar in design to the famous bronze lions of Trafalgar Square by Edwin Henry Landseer with Marochetti, installed 1867. They are also smaller (and appear from below to lack tongues). The bridge was given its current name in 1898."

According to legend and historic facts the baptism of Vladimir the Great took place in 988 in Chersonesus. The idea to immortalize the place of the Baptism of the Holy Prince was first represented in 1825, by the Black Sea Fleet Chief, vice-admiral Alexey Greig. On his initiative, excavations were conducted at the site of Chersonesus Taurica in 1827. As a result, several remains of ancient Christian churches were found out at the center of the market square, including a cruciform basilica. In 1830 the historians Frédéric Dubois de Montpéreux and N. Murzakevich made the conjecture that Vladimir the Great was baptized in this basilica, which dispelled all doubts about the place of the future Church. The construction took 15 years and was finished in 1874-1876. Тhe consecration of the Cathedral took place on October 17 1891, though the final decorative design was complited only in 1894. As far back as 1859, the marble reliquary in form of Gospel with relics of Grand Prince St. Vladimir was passed from the Small Church of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to Chersonesus. After the building of Chersonesus Cathedral, his relics were placed in the Lower Church near the ruins of the ancient basilica. At the Upper Church altar is situated the list from the miracle-working Korsun icon of the Mother of God, which, according to legend, was brought from Chersonesus by Vladimir the Great. Altogether, the relics of 115 saints were passed to Cathedral. It was closed down by the Soviets in the 1920s and blown up by the Nazis in 1944. The work on its restoration began in the late 1990s, even though it was made more active only in 2000. The consecration of the high altar of St. Vladimir Cathedral in Chersonesus took place on April 3, 2004."

Between Lakeland and points north, the station code is '''LAK'''. Between Lakeland and points south, the station code is '''LKL'''. So, for example, the segments of a round-trip between Lakeland and Miami would be LKL-MIA & MIA-LKL. The segments of a trip between Miami and Jacksonville, with a stay in Lakeland, would be MIA-LKL & LAL-JAX. The station was opened in 1998 and has an enclosed waiting area, but no other features, like a lounge, Quick-Trak kiosk, long-term parking, baggage carts, lockers, ATM, or wi-fi. The ''Silver Starr'' route passes through the station twice in each direction—before and after Tampa. Heading south (New York-Miami), passengers may debark only (boarding is not allowed) ''before'' the train reaches Tampa; when the train stops in Lakeland ''after'' Tampa, only new passengers may board (no debarking). This order is reversed when heading northbound (Miami-New York). Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach service is available between Lakeland and Orlando, Tampa, Pinellas Park-St. Petersburg, Bradenton, Sarasota, Port Charlotte and Fort Myers. Thruway Motorcoach service is booked together with train travel with Amtrak. Public transportation is available with Citrus Connection bus service. The Lakeland Downtown terminal is located just a few blocks away on the west side of N. Florida Ave., north of the tracks, but crosses a few busy roads and is very close to some shady neighborhoods...so best not to walk between the terminal and the station after dark.

After its reconstruction in 1963 became part of the exhibition of the Budapest History Museum. - The first chapel in the castle was probably built in the 14th century during the reign of Louis I of Hungary. Eberhard Windecke claimed in his Chronicle that Charles II of Hungary was murdered in 1386 in a room from which the royal chapel could be seen. The chapel was again mentioned in the Chronicle of Lorenzo de Monaci, which was written around 1390. - King Sigismund of Luxemburg thoroughly rebuilt the old Anjou castle during the first decades of the 15th century. He erected a Gothic church in place of the former chapel. The Anjou castle's façade was now facing towards the inner palace courtyard, and the long chancel was projecting from the eastern side of the palace. The chancel was built upon a lower church due to a lack of space on the narrow plateau. The church had a 21m long nave and an 11m long chancel. The flamboyant Royal Church of Buda Castle was similar to the more famous Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. - Archeological research proved the date of the church, because 15th century strata were discovered under the intact brick floor of the lower church. - In November 1489, Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman empire sent the relics of John the Almoner to King Matthias Corvinus. The King placed the relics in the Royal Chapel, which was re-dedicated and embellished with Renaissance furniture. In 1526, Buda was plundered by the Ottoman Turks after the Battle of Mohács. The relics were rescued in time and carried to Pressburg, where they are still kept currently. A surviving church inventory from 1530 shows a wealth of furnishings. Later, King János Szapolyai converted the lower church into a bastion. The large Gothic windows were walled up; and only the rectangular arrow slits were left open. - In 1541 the Ottoman Turks captured Buda without resistance, and the Royal Church ceased to be a place of Christian worship. The upper church was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda, and the ruins were demolished in 1715. The vault of the lower church collapsed, and the interior was filled with rubbish. The remains were then buried under the new Baroque terrace for two centuries. - The ruins of the lower church were discovered by archeologists in 1949–50. The remains were buried in 1953 because of conceptional disputes about the possible reconstruction. The chapel, finally reconstructed by 1963, was re-consecrated in 1990"

Later on, a well-known artist of the time, Ioan Sima -born in Pericei ( Salaj county),- donated his personal painting collection, on the condition to be preserved in a proper place, being the central place of a memorial museum. The county leadership decided that the building on the Gheorghe Doja Street no. 6 be offered to the county museum. On the 9th July 1981, a new section of the History and Art Museum was inaugurated and was named the “ Ioan Sima’ Arts Gallery. The Arts Gallery exhibited in 1981 Ioan Sima’s paintings in seven large rooms properly organized to offer a proper space to museum activities. But soon the space proved to be too cramped and the organization of other personal or group exhibitions was practically impossible. In this context, the museum was offered (in 1983) 8 more rooms, now having a larger exhibition space. On the 1981 opening of the gallery, the Museum already owned an important number of painting and sculpture items. The central point of attraction was undoubtless the collection of 162 paintings and graphic items forming the “Ioan Sima” Collection. Later on the artist donated 40 more paintings, enlarging the collection. More than that, he even donated his furniture items, popular art items, his personal archive as well as other personal objects. Following the master’s example, his niece, Maria Margareta Botezatu, donated the gallery a part of the paintings offered by her uncle. The consequence of these gestures is an attempt to stress the artistic and human profile of the artist Ioan Sima, the gallery permanently exhibiting an important part of his most representative works of art. The internal organization of the exhibition was made by the specialist in museography Pia Maria Badiu, a very close friend of the painter, and she tried to exhibit the works classifying them on different themes, creative stages, thus defining Ioan Sima’s place among the great Romanian and universal artists. In the attempt to become a cultural contemporary centre, the collection becomes larger with the years. It contains works belonging to the Romanian artists Corneliu Baba, Aurel Ciupe, Rudolf Schwitzer Cumpana, Petre Abrudan, Alexandru Mohi, Paul Sima, Ioan Mitrea, the most important operas coming from the painting schools in Cluj, Baia Mare, Timisoara and Oradea. Organising more exhibitions every year, the collection was enlarged by the donations made by the contemporary artists Teodor Botis, Victor Gaga, Vasile Pop Negresteanu, Eugen Patachi, Aurel Contras, Gheorghe Ilea, Marcel Munteanu and their students. The Gallery is a remarcable cultural centre, becoming known in the country due to its important exhibitions. A great collection of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera – bought by the museum from Tokacs Adalbert , a passioned Zalau collectioner is housed at the entrance of the gallery. The etmological collection ( constituted through the collectioner’s efforts to gather and classify local and universal species) offers the public a pleasant foray into the natural science. The butterflies colours as well as the size of the bugs is frequently raising admirative exclamations. These items attract mostly the young public. The gallery is coordinated by the museographic staff, covering all the museum activities ( especially public guiding), museographic pedagogy, activities of item preservation. In the same time the staff organizes concerts, instrumental recitals ( especially piano recitals) or other events."

Republiky 5. The ''Obecní dům'' was built near the Powder Tower (a storage place for gunpowder and a major trade route entry into the city) on a site called King's Court where once a royal residence stood. In 1901, the Prague Civic Society made a proposal to city authorities to build a center for official and social Czech events. As happened so many other times in recent Prague history, the Czechs were trying to balance the grand buildings erected by the German-speaking community of Prague with suitable edifices of their own. The ""German House"" (now co-opted and renamed Slovanský dům, or Slavic House, on Na Příkopě street) and a German casino were enough to make the Czechs want a place of their own.  :Lovers of Art Nouveau should bless the memories of the Prague Civic Society's officials, because the Obecní dům would become one of the most beautiful examples of Art Nouveau in Prague, filled with artwork by the best Czech artists of the day. Neo-Baroque, neo-Renaissance, Western and Oriental influences – all combined with traditional Czech Art Nouveau. This is what makes the Obecnàdum unique among many beautiful examples of Art Nouveau public buildings in Prague. While the exterior is impressive, the interior is both finely crafted and educational. Almost every prominent living Czech artist worked on the Obecní dům. Painters Mikoláš Aleš, Václav Jansa, Alfons Mucha, Jakub Obrovský, Jan Preisler, Josef Wenig, Karel Spillar, Max Švabinský, Josef Ullman, František Zenoek, and the sculptors Josef Maratka, Josef Václav Myslbek, Karel Novak, Ladislav Šaloun, František Uprka, Bohumil Kafka and Čeněk Vosmík carved out an astounding backdrop for the many historical events that would transpire here. Though their contributions are not conspicuously noted, in some cases (such as Alfons Mucha's Mayoral Hall) it is obvious which artist decorated what room."

Founded in 1802 by Count Ferenc Széchenyi, whose manuscript, map, numismatic and print collections formed its initial core holdings, the Hungarian National Museum was designed and built by the popular architect Mihály Polláck between 1837-1847. When it opened, it was the fourth largest museum in Europe and '''the first public museum''' in the Hungarian capital. The building became the symbol of the 1848-1849 Revolution so every year on the National Day (March 15) usually commemoration held here. However, it was far enough from the city proper that sometimes loose cattle from the weekly Kálvin tér market wandered into the museum.<br>Before entering, take note of the museum's '''exterior''', a fine example of neoclassical architecture, with an exceptional portico. Eight Corinthian columns support a frieze with an ornamental cornice and a large pediment. The pediment features the allegorical figure of Pannonia (''Pannonia'' was the Roman name for the Hungarian lands) sitting with the Hungarian coat of arms on her shield, surrounded on either side by Science and Art.<br>The exterior of the museum is also significant for what has taken place there. According to a popular urban legend during the 1848 revolutions that swept through Central Europe, on 15 March, Sándor Petőfi (perhaps Hungary's most famous patriotic poet) recited his emotionally gripping poem called ""National Song"" to a large crowd from the left pillar of the National Museum's exterior staircase. This poem pleaded with the nation to liberate Hungary from the Habsburg oppression. Not everyone was impressed. The director of the museum recorded in his diary that a noisy mob had gathered outside the building that day, disturbing his work so much that he left for home.<br>Major acquisitions and collections donated by the Kubinyi, Pyrker, Marczibányi and Jankovich families rapidly expanded the museum's holdings. Late in the 19th century some collections were separated from the general holdings to form new specialized museums such as the Museum(s) of Fine Arts, Applied Arts, Natural Science and Ethnography. Today the museum's five major divisions (archaeology, Middle Ages, modern era, numismatics, historical paintings), two permanent exhibitions, and archaeological library (with over 100,000 volumes!) make it one of the richest museums in Central Europe."

Between Lakeland and points north, the station code is '''LAK'''. Between Lakeland and points south, the station code is '''LKL'''. So, for example, the segments of a round-trip between Lakeland and Miami would be LKL-MIA & MIA-LKL. The segments of a trip between Miami and Jacksonville, with a stay in Lakeland, would be MIA-LKL & LAL-JAX. The station was opened in 1998 and has an enclosed waiting area, but no other features, like a lounge, Quick-Trak kiosk, long-term parking, baggage carts, lockers, ATM, or wi-fi. The ''Silver Starr'' route passes through the station twice in each direction—before and after Tampa. Heading south (New York-Miami), passengers may debark only (boarding is not allowed) ''before'' the train reaches Tampa; when the train stops in Lakeland ''after'' Tampa, only new passengers may board (no debarking). This order is reversed when heading northbound (Miami-New York). Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach service is available between Lakeland and Orlando, Tampa, Pinellas Park-St. Petersburg, Bradenton, Sarasota, Port Charlotte and Fort Myers. Thruway Motorcoach service is booked together with train travel with Amtrak. Public transportation is available with Citrus Connection bus service. The Lakeland Downtown terminal is located just a few blocks away on the west side of N. Florida Ave., north of the tracks, but crosses a few busy roads and is very close to some shady neighborhoods...so best not to walk between the terminal and the station after dark.

Carnegie also has an excellent, smaller recital hall, Weill Recital Hall, where many debut recitals and chamber music concerts take place. The Metropolitan Opera is one of the most famous in the world and has a storied history. People interested in the way the opera works behind the scenes can sign up for backstage tours, which cover such things as the construction and maintenance of the house, the movement of sets on the stage, the construction of sets and costumes, the special loading dock for animals needed onstage and the rehearsal stage where the singer/actors can work on blocking. The New York Philharmonic performs at Geffen Hall, formerly called Avery Fisher Hall and like the Met, at Lincoln Center on the Upper West Side. Other major halls include Alice Tully Hall, where Chamber Music at Lincoln Center and Mostly Mozart have their seasons and also the Kaufmann Center at the 92nd St. Y and Merkin Hall, both of which among other things often feature contemporary classical music. New York also has several conservatories of music, the most famous of which is the Juilliard School, also at Lincoln Center. New York was also the birthplace of the famous composer, songwriter and pianist, George Gershwin (1898-1937), arguably (with Ives the most frequent alternative choice) America's greatest classical composer, who was also famous for his Broadway shows and popular songs, and as a jazz musician. New York is also generally considered to have succeeded Vienna as the center of the classical music world and especially musical Modernism for the remainder of the 20th century after the rise of Nazism in Europe. Charles Ives, Edgard Varèse and Béla Bartók are among the many Modernist composers who lived in New York."

It is located west of the settlement of Qobustan, on the west bank of the Caspian Sea. Date back as far as the 12th century BCE. The invading armies of Alexander the Great and Trajan also left some interesting graffiti. The territory of Qobustan is cut up with numerous, sometimes rather deep ravines (in Azerbaijani: gobu). That is a suggested origin of the Qobustan geographical name. This is a national historical landmark of Azerbaijan in an attempt to preserve the ancient carvings, relics, mud volcanoes and gas-stones in the region. The mountains Boyukdash, Kichikdash, Jingirdag, and the Yazili hill were taken under legal government protection. Throughout many centuries under impact of the sun, wind, seismic activity and various atmospheric precipitation, blocks of stones broke away from the edges of a vast limestone layer and rolled down the slopes. Here, in the area displaying the fantastic scene of destruction, the huge blocks of stones and rocks chaotically pressed against each other, forming about 20 big and small caves and the canopies serving as a natural shelter to the inhabitants. - Qobustan is very rich in archaeological monuments. The reserve has more than 6,000 rock engravings dating back between 5,000 - 40,000 years. Most of the rock engravings depict primitive men, animals, battle-pieces, ritual dances, bullfights, boats with armed oarsmen, warriors with lances in their hands, camel caravans, pictures of sun and stars. '''Flora''': The vegetative world of Qobustan has a character that is common for deserts and semi-deserts. It consists of ephemeris grasses and bushes, wormwood and similar long-term plants. Among heaps of stones and rocks a wild rose, a dwarfish cherry, Hibernian honeysuckle, a juniper, wild pear, wild fig, wild pomegranate, grapes and some other kinds of trees and bushes are rather often met decorating the stern landscape. '''Fauna''': The fauna of Qobustan has strongly grown poor for the last decades of years. The natural inhabitants of Qobustan now are rare foxes, jackals, wolves, hares and wild cats, mountain chickens, wild pigeons, larks alongside with numerous snakes and lizards and some others. - '''Mud volcanoes''': Azerbaijan and its Caspian coastline are home to nearly 400 mud volcanoes, more than half the total throughout the world. In 2001, one mud volcano 15 km from Baku made world headlines when it suddenly started ejecting flames 15 m high. - Many geologists as well as locals and international mud tourists trek to such places as the Firuz Crater, Qobustan, Salyan and end up happily covered in mud which is thought to have medicinal qualities. On the average, every twenty years or so, a mud volcano may explode with great force in Qobustan, shooting flames hundreds of metres into the sky, and depositing tonnes of mud on the surrounding area. The appearance of the Zoroastrian religion in Azerbaijan almost 2,000 years ago is closely connected with these geological phenomena, and Azerbaijan's etymology - Land of the Eternal Fire derives from its Zoroastrian history."

His father, Andrew McCormack had been lured to Ahlone, from Galasheils in the Scottish lowlands by the prospect of employment in Athlone Woollen Mills. In time Andrew was to become a foreman in these Mills which had a world-wide reputation for the quality of the tweeds they produced. In 1903 John won the coveted gold medal in the tenor class of the Dublin Feis Ceoil. It was this victory which was to lead to a phenomenal singing career. In 1907 John made his operatic debut in Covent Gardens in Cavaleria Rusticana. He was made Count of the Papal Court in 1928 by Pope Pius Xl. Having conquered the operatic world John turned his attention to the concert stage where he was soon to become the most popular lyric tenor of his day. Apart from his rendition of popular Irish songs John McCormack was renowned for his masterful singing of German lieder He made successful concert tours of America, Australia and Europe but in Ireland the highlight of his career was his singing of Panis Angelicus at the open air mass for the Eucharistic Congress in Dublin's Phoenix Park in 1932. John's colourful career spanned almost forty years and included a brief but lucrative career in Hollywood. His earnings for the film Song O'My Heart in 1930 was estimated to be in the region of $500,000 John McCormack died in Dublin on September 16, 1945 and is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

Immediately after the February Revolution of 1917, Tauride Palace housed the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet. The abortive Russian Constituent Assembly held its meetings there in 1918. Since the 1990s, Tauride Palace has been home to the Interparliamentary Assembly of Member Nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States (IPA CIS). - Take a '''Parliament tour''' in Tauride Palace: During the tour, guests will make a walk in three state rooms and other spaces of the Tauride Palace, learn the history of its inhabitants, visit the magnificent Duma Hall - the place of the State Duma of the Russian Empire, to see an exhibition on the history of Russian parliamentarism. - Duration: 60min. - Only possible by prior arrangement with a passport. -"

In 1299, the Dominican Friar Guillaume Bernard de Sévérac bought a house near the church, where he established a monastery with 12 friars. A new, much larger church was built near or above the chapel of San Paolo in 1325. Thereafter the church was officially dedicated to San Domenico. After the Fall of Constantinople, according to the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire with the Republic of Genoa, the church, which by that time was known by the Turks under the name of Mesa Domenico, remained in Genoese hands, but between 1475 and 1478 it was transformed, with minor modifications, into a mosque by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II and became known as Galata Camii (""Galata Mosque"") or Cami-i Kebir (""Great Mosque""). Towards the end of the century Sultan Bayezid II assigned the building to those Muslims of Spain (Andalusia) who had fled the Spanish Inquisition and migrated to Istanbul; hence the present name Arap Camii (Arab Mosque). Today, Arap Camii is the largest mosque on the Galata side of the Golden Horn. It is one of the most interesting mosques in the city due to its early Italian Gothic architectural style and church belfry, which has practically remained unaltered even after being converted into a minaret."

Its interior decorations are especially interesting as a fine example of the French Renaissance style. At the same time, its historical significance is hard to overestimate, since it was the preferred residence of French kings and emperors for 7 centuries. The first mention of the castle dates back to 1137 but by the time when François I decided to make it his principal residence (1527), the medieval castle was mostly in ruins. This monarch undertook an ambitious reconstruction program, playing himself the role of the chief architect and inviting two prominent Italian artists, Rosso and Primatice to decorate the interior. Their collaboration resulted in such treasures as the François I gallery (pictured right) with wooden panels, stuccoes and frescoes depicting various episodes from the life of the king; the Church of the Trinity and the Ball room are also from this epoch. After François I, many French monarchs chose Fontainebleau as their residence; the construction started by François I was mostly completed under Henri II and Henri IV. Louis XIII, the son of Henri IV was born in Fontainebleau; the tourists can see the room where Marie de' Medici delivered the baby and imagine how crowded it was at the time: to avoid any risk of substitution, the birth of the king must take place in presence of many witnesses.Somewhat neglected during the French Revolution, the Fontainebleau castle is back to its glory under the reign of Napoleon I, who lived there for a long time and bade his farewell to his troops in the court of the castle in 1814. The visitor can see the Emperor's Throne room (unique in France) and his private apartments. Pope Pie VII visited Fontainebleau twice, first as a guest and then as a prisoner of Napoleon; the papal quarters have recently been opened to visitors. After your visit to the main building, do not forget to take a stroll in the park and the gardens around the castle; you will see Diane's fountain and (if you are lucky) meet one of the peacocks who live there. Although by no means less interesting than the Versailles castle, the Fontainebleau castle is a bit more difficult to reach and less known to tourists; as a result, there are at least ten times less visitors in Fontainebleau than in Versailles. Except maybe on national holidays, there is never a queue to get in, and you can explore the immense castle almost on your own, which, together with the fresh air and the absence of street vendors contributes to make your visit a very peaceful and enjoyable experience. The castle is open every day except Tuesday, January 1, May 1 and December 25th, from 9h30 to 17h in winter and from 9h30 to 18h in summer. As of April 2011, the entrance fee for adults is 10 euros; children below 18 and residents of the European Union below 26 enter free. UNESCO World Heritage Site [http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/160]"

Mean while R.P. Gautam who had come on retirement from Central Reserve Police Force as Commandant, visualised the vast potential in paragliding from Bandla mountain. To make his dream come true, he got in contact with Shakti Singh Chandel, the then Director Tourism and Civil Aviation, to extend all possible help to promote paragliding not only in Bilaspur, but also in whole in Himachal Pradesh. The Director Tourism, who himself belonged to Bilaspur, took keen interest in approving Bandla top as take off site, gave financial assistance to run para gliding courses for Bilaspur under Himachal Aero Adventure Institute Bilaspur, which under expert guidance of Mr. Bruce Mills from New Zealand and Alexi Garisimov from Russia,Vikram Sharma the Local Pilot got the pilots trained. Thus Bilaspur was brought on World Map in Paragliding.  What is special about Bilaspur, which is not there in flying sites at other places, is that it gives you almost eight hours of flying time as against 3 to 4 hours maximum at Billing or Manali. More over it has vast and safe landing grounds on the bank of Govind Sagar Lake at LUHNU. From training point of view,  Bilaspur can be considered the best in whole of Asia. It is laid down in the training manual that training in instability maneuvers during advance pilot course  i.e. Dynamic Stall, deep stall, spiral drive, spin reovery, assymmetric tuck, front tuck and deployment of Reserve Parachute, should be carried out over a broad base of water for reasons. For this, there is hardly any place, where there is any huge lake just beside the landing site. Bilaspur has the privilege of having unique combination of Air Sports in one stretch, which is very rare.Local contact person for paragliding in Bilaspur is Vikram Sharma (Sonu) one may contact him any time at his mail id vikramsharma003@gmail.com."

It has a large geomorphological value because significant sections on the Loess plateau had never been felled in history, thus retaining the characteristics of a primeval forest. The highest point reaches 133 m above sea level. The source of the IJse is situated in the center of the Sonian Forest, and its trajectory spawned countless ponds, creeks and marshes. Archaeological evidence of human activity in the Sonian Forest has been traced back to neolithic remains over 5000 years old. Remains of iron ore smelters from the Carolingian era have also been found. It is presumably under the reign of Charles the Great (768-814) that the Sonian Forest got split off from the Silva Carbonaria and developed an independent fauna and flora. Under Austrian reign in the 18th century, thousands of beech trees were planted, which is still visible today. From the 18th century onwards, the forest saw increasing economic importance: several monasteries and priories were built in and around it, and the countless ponds served to provide them with a supply of fish whereas the forest itself had a hunting ground function. Nearly nothing of these buildings remains today, but the intense network of droveways reveals their historic locations and importance. Under French reign, from 1794 to 1814, the Sonian Forest was nationalized, and large areas were felled for economic reasons. After the Belgian independence of 1830, parts of the forest were sold off to individuals to fill the new country's treasury, but in 1843 it became property of the state. The first half of the 19th century brought new disaster to the forest, however, when in 1832 the General Society (''Société Generale'') started the construction of roads that cut the forest in smaller pieces. A railway connection between Brussels and Terhulpen was constructed in 1854, further dividing the forest. After the Second World War, the roads were significantly widened and paved, then later upgraded to the highways that still exist today, and are part of the Brussels Ringway R0. The lack of tunnels or bridges make them a significant barrier for the fauna in the forest: foxes, boars, frogs, toads, deers, and recently also budgerigars. Although only a tiny fraction of the Sonian forest is geographically situated in Kraainem, the forest has become very popular with locals for recreation purposes. The forest offers excellent opportunities for hiking, Nordic walking, jogging and cycling. Fishing or camping are not allowed, however. The forest can be reached from the Kraainem center with bus 316 direction Leuven (get off at ''Middenlaan'') or explored by Villo bike (see ''Get around'')."

At 113 metres long, 58 metres in width and 34 metres tall, it is only slightly smaller than Notre-Dame and thus the second largest church in the city. It is dedicated to Sulpitius the Pious. During the 18th century, an elaborate gnomon, the Gnomon of Saint-Sulpice, was constructed in the church. In front of the church itself is the magnificent Place Saint-Sulpice which contains the 'Fountain of the Four Bishops'. The church has a long-standing tradition of talented organists that dates back to the eighteenth century. In 1862, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll reconstructed and improved the existing organ built by François-Henri Clicquot. Though using many materials from Clicquot's French Classical organ, it is considered to be Cavaillé-Coll's magnum opus, featuring 102 speaking stops, and is perhaps the most impressive instrument of the romantic French symphonic-organ era. Its organists have also been renowned, starting with Nicolas Séjan in the 18th century, and continuing with Charles-Marie Widor (organist 1870-1933) and Marcel Dupré (organist 1934-1971), both great organists and composers of organ music.

The town was at 8 km from the pass between Banat and Transylvania, which old name was Tapae, today Iron Gates of Transylvania.The settlement date of the capital is not known exactly. An inscription discovered at the beginning of the 14th century, in the village Gradiste - Sarmizegetusa says: ""On the command of the emperor Cesar Nerva Traianus Augustus, son of the devine Nerva, was settled the Dacian Colony by Decimus Terentius Scaurianus, its governor"". The name of the governor shows that the settlement of the new town was done in the first years of the concerning of Dacia (after some opinions in 106-107, after others 108-110). The settlement of the colony was marked also by the emission of a coin (sestertius) at Rome, from the Senate order, dedicated to ""the best ruler"", Traian emperor. The choosing of the place of the town by Traian was not at random. The metropolis had some strategical and economical advantages. Retezat Mountains at the South and Poiana Ruscai Mountains at the North were natural barriers difficult to cross for the eventual invaders. The capital, who's territory territorium was from Tibiscum to Micia till the entrance in the Jiu pass, was developing in peace, defended by the Roman camps Tibiscum (today Jupa), Voislova, Micia (Vetel) and Bumbesti. By Ulpia Traian was crossing the imperial road from Danube and marked the link between the North of the province to Porolissum (Moigrad).The antic city had an area of 32 ha surrounded by walls. In the hearth of the city were to main roads (cardo maximus oriented North-South and decumanus maximus oriented East-West), at its crossing being the main public building - Forum. But the city was not only inside the walls. Outside the walls, on a great area, were the village, the craftsmen workshops (brick makers, glass blowers), the temples and other public or private buildins. Also outside the walls were the cemeteries of the city (sepulcreta) identified at East and also at the West. The population was around 25.000 - 30.000 people.

You might not get that from the front view, but try watching the light change on its roofs and towers during sunset from one of the cafés on the Ile de St. Louis, the '''Lutece''' for instance. Alternatively, go to the top floor of the Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville (BHV) department store opposite, on rue de Rivoli and walk up a flight of stairs to the roof terrace (terrasse), from which there is a dramatic view of both the roof of the Hôtel de Ville and the immediate surroundings and river. The present Hôtel de Ville replaced the 16th century original which was burned down during the Commune in 1871. A pastiche of its predecessor, but on a far larger scale, it was designed by the architects Ballu and Deperthes, chosen after a competition, and was mostly completed by 1882. The building is lavishly, and some would say heavy-handedly, decorated both inside and out, and finished in an arrestingly white stone, similar to that used for the even more eye-catching Sacre-Coeur basilica. The statue on the garden wall on the south side is of Etienne Marcel, the most famous holder of the post of ""prevôt des marchands"" (provost of merchants) which pre-dated the office of mayor. Marcel came to a sticky end, lynched in 1358 by an angry mob after trying to assert the city's powers a little too energetically. The current mayor, Bertrand Delanoë, a socialist and the city's first openly gay leader, shares some of Marcel's ambition and almost shared his fate. He was stabbed in the building in 2002 during the first all-night, city-wide Sleepless Night (Nuit Blanche) festival when the long inaccessible building's doors were thrown open to the public. But Delanoe recovered and has not lost his zeal for access, later converting the mayor's sumptuous private apartments into a crèche for the children of municipal workers. The Hôtel de Ville was for many years the private fiefdom of Jacques Chirac, France's president before Sarkozy, and was the site of a scandal centring on both illegal jobs given to Chirac's party members and an immense entertainment budget. General de Gaulle greeted the crowds from a front window in 1944 when Paris was liberated from the Germans and Robespierre was shot in the jaw and arrested in the original building in 1794. Admirers of Hôtel de Ville's architecture will want to know that Ballu also built the Church of La Trinité in the 9th arrondissement and the belfry of the town hall of the 1st arrondissement, opposite the Louvre's east façade. Ballu also restored the Tour St Jacques (see below), which has recently been uncovered after restoration work lasting over a decade."

On 12 February 1667, a monastery was founded in Brussels -- then part of the Southern Netherlands -- but the success of the order was strongly variable in time and by the first half of the 19th century it was nearly extinct in Brussels. A second start on 21 November 1845 had more success, and not even a century later the original location was too small to house the order. Architect Paul Bellot, born in 1876 and specialized in religious architecture, was tasked with the design of a new monastery located outside Brussels. Then still rural Kraainem was chosen because of its remote location, at the time there were no other buildings on the hill, and the closest settlement was Laag Kraainem which was only accessible by a narrow unpaved road (currently the Kapellelaan). Construction started in 1928, and by the end of 1930 when it was finished, the monastery had become a popular pilgrim destination. Unlike similar monasteries in Belgium, which started out small and were gradually expanded, the availability of sufficient space and budget allowed the entire site to be built at once between 1928 and 1930. All buildings thus show the same style elements, many of which were typical for the designs of Paul Bellot: polychrome bricks from Zandvoorde (a municipality close to Oostende near the Belgian coast) and extensive use of concrete for structural and decorative purposes. Art deco and brick modernism influences can be observed in all aspects of construction. Only the building sides facing the streets (Kapellelaan and Hebronlaan) are decorated (for example, a Madonna sculpture above the entrance), the sides facing the inner sanctum, gardens and orchards do not have any decoration. The architecture and degree of decoration reveals the originally intended purpose of the rooms in the buildings, a feature called ''architecture parlante''. The facades are also hierarchically decorated, with the chapel as most important and thus most extensively decorated part of the structure. The interior resembles a Medieval monastery, with style elements of the Arabic and Mozarabic arts. Illumination was considered paramount by Paul Bellot, and windows are consequently large enough to illuminate the rooms they are intended for, without penalizing decoration. Much of the original woodworking, both indoor and outdoor, has been preserved, as evidenced by the oak inner doors and staircases. The monastery is still in use today, and remains the only Salesian monastery in Belgium. It is not normally opened to visitors, reservations are mandatory. The monastery can be reached from Laag Kraainem by following the Jozef van Hovestraat and afterwards the Kappellelaan up the hill."

It was here that General George Washington forged his Continental Army into a fighting force, during the difficult winter encampment of 1777-78. Of all places associated with America's War for Independence, none conveys the suffering, sacrifice and ultimate triumph more than Valley Forge. No battles were fought, no bayonet charges or artillery bombardments took place. Nonetheless, some 2,000 soldiers died - more Americans than were killed at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown combined. Valley Forge is the story of an army's epic struggle to survive against terrible odds, hunger, disease and the unrelenting forces of nature. Today, the park is a lush, 3,600-acre expanse of rolling hillsides dotted with flowering dogwood trees. Washington's original stone headquarters has been restored and furnished; log huts have been reconstructed; and statues and monuments throughout the park remind visitors of the American national heritage.

The oldest parts of the cathedral are from the 14th century, but the cathedral was not completed in the Medieval period. The highest tower was completed in Renaissance and Baroque styles much later, as is clearly obvious. The Western portal and both Western towers are even younger, completed in the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the original Medieval plans were used for them and their relatively small age is not obvious. St. Vitus Cathedral was the place of royal coronations and also the location of the remains of several famous Czech Kings (notably Charles IV, of Charles Bridge fame). Go around the cathedral so you not only see the '''Western portal''' with the rose window and beautiful gargoyles, but also the original medieval '''Golden Portal''' in the south and the stunning '''Flying Buttresses''' in the east. Things not to miss inside the cathedral include the '''stained glass Rose Window''' in the west portal, the '''stained glass window by Alfons Mucha''', the '''tomb of St. John of Nepomuk''' made of pure silver, the '''Royal Crypt''' underneath the cathedral (with the graves of Charles IV, his four wives, Wenceslas IV, Ladislas the Posthumous, George of Podebrady, Rudolf II, and Marie Amalie of Austria, the daughter of Maria Theresa of Austria) and the stunning '''St. Wenceslas Chapel''' with the relics of the saint and walls decorated with gold and more than 1300 gems. The Czech Coronation Jewels are kept behind the door with the seven locks (seven important people including the Czech President and the Czech Prime Minister keep the keys) in the St. Wenceslas Chapel.

The upper floor serves the Isaan region in the northeast of Thailand. The ground floor serves Northern Thailand, and shares some destinations with Ekkamai (including Pattaya, Rayong, Chanthaburi and Trat). The bus terminal is a fair hike from BTS station Mo Chit or MRT station Chatuchak Park. Motorbike taxis do the trip for a fixed 50 baht fare (bargaining is pointless), while tuk-tuks charge whatever they feel like — when bargaining, remember that a real taxi with air conditioning will cost you about 45 baht (assuming little traffic). You can also take '''Bus 77''' and pay the 13 baht flat fare on board (this bus also goes from the terminal via Victory Monument, Pratunam, and Silom Rd). If you have a considerable amount of luggage, the easiest, if not necessarily fastest, option is to take a taxi directly to or from the bus terminal. :From Feb 2013 air conditioned buses became available directly from Bangkok Mo Chit to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, Cambodia.

The Cham constructed the Bánh Ít site to fit in harmony with the environment, and while not as enormous as ancient sites in Angkor or Borobudur, the site even today is a beautiful medley of rolling countryside hills, river and towers. Although the site had nothing to do with silver, early French colonialists named Champa sites after minerals, and their name of ""Silver Towers"" stuck and is still used today by many foreign sources. The most common name used for the towers by the Vietnamese, Bánh Ít, is also the name of the local sweet cake specialty.  Approaching from the east, the first tower is the 13-metre (42-foot) gate. Up the hill from the gate are the three larger towers. The biggest is 20 metres (65 feet) high, with intricate carvings of humans, birds, flowers, and the elephant god Ganesa and the monkey god Viyu in dancing pose. The architectural style is unique among Cham ruins for the vertical columns and grooved tiles, the use of sandstone for the roof edges, and false doors topped by soaring arches in the shape of spears. The site held many statues, but sadly, most of them were shipped off to Europe by French colonialists in the late 19th century. The most impressive of the artworks, an intricately-carved 11th-century statue of a three-eyed Shiva seated on a lotus, is held in the Musée Guimet in Paris, while copper statues of Genesha, Uma, and Brahma vanished into private French collectors' hands in the early 20th century.  If you're feeling particularly adventurous, the undeveloped countryside around the main towers is full of small centuries-old ruins. Although only the four complete towers survive, the area had many more buildings, and poorly-funded archaeological surveys haven't had the resources to completely investigate the grounds. Small fragments are hidden in many places in the undergrowth, and, with luck, you can even find complete corner pieces of several buildings overgrown by trees, particularly to the east of the main site. But don't disturb anything: you're allowed to explore the ruins, but it's illegal to take, sell, export, or damage any historical relics in Vietnam.  The Bánh Ít site is located just east of the junction between Highway 1A and Highway 19. Halfway between Quy Nhơn and Phù Cát airport, you can easily combine a visit with a trip to or from the airport. As with all sites outside the city centre, '''driving your own car or motorbike is the most convenient transportation option''' as it gives you the flexibility to explore the surrounding countryside. A taxi from the city takes 15&ndash;30 minutes to the towers and costs about 100,000&nbsp;dong from the north centre of the city and up to 200,000&nbsp;dong if coming from the southwest beach side. Two bus routes, T4 and T6, run infrequently from stops in the city at the Quang Trung roundabout and Tháp Đôi Towers, leaving you a 20-minute walk from the towers at at the junction of Highway 1A and Highway 19. The bus costs 10,000&nbsp;dong, but if you're tight on time, stick to a taxi: the bus schedule is infrequent and even the scheduled buses often fail to appear.  Another transportation option is the airport shuttle bus which services arriving and departing flights. From the airport, the shuttle bus travels south down Highway 1A. If you stand on the west side of the road, you can hail the bus. Tickets normally cost 50,000&nbsp;dong from the airport, but if there's space in the shuttle, the driver will pick you up and take you to the city for 25,000&nbsp;dong from the towers."

Worth seeing even if you don't intend to swim (in summer, the outdoor part is open to visitors; entrance to indoor part is paid). See the Baths section in Budapest for details. - '''About the hotel''': Hotel Gellért is a famous, first class four star hotel in Budapest, Hungary. The hotel was erected on the right bank of the river Danube between 1916 and 1918 in the (Secession) Art Nouveau style with some biomorphic elements, at the foot of Gellért Hill, next to Szabadság Bridge. The four star Danubius Hotel Gellért, onetime Saint Gellért Hotel and Spa, was renovated in 1962 and in 1973. The spa, swimming pool and plaza built to the hotel is one of the most beautiful spas in Budapest. Hotel Gellért got the name „the first lady of Hungarian tourism”. Gellért is one of the most famous historical hotels in Europe, which is well-known among businessmen and tourists as well. - Inside of the hotel is built in Art Nouveau style with high glass cupola and wrought iron decoration. The characteristic, oriental cone-shaped towers of the hotel and eventful frontage attract the look from long distances. Inside the hotel less, but more in the spa the original Art Nouveau furnishing stayed with artistic mosaics, colourful windows and statues. The ornament of the stairs starting from the reception in the hotel is the glass window, made on the basis of layouts of Bozó Stanisits, representing the Chase of the Miraculous Deer from the famous old Hungarian legend. At the beginning of the 20th century the apartments of the nobles were characteristically magnificent, while the other rooms were simply furnished with carefully designed pieces. The stylish furnishing of the rooms does credit to the work carried out by artists under the direction of Ferenc Szabja. The domed hall opened to a formal courtyard which was used as a conservatory with its sliding glass roof. The semi-circular lawned courtyard was surrounded by an alcove for the orchestra and a colonnade of the pump-room. The Indian maharajahs with their numerous attendants visiting Europe frequently put up at the luxuriously comfortable Hotel Gellért. During and after World War II the richly coloured coffered ceiling of the galleried foyer and the domed hall reminiscent of the great halls of the Roman thermal baths suffered almost irreparable damage. At the end of the 50’s the reconstruction of the hotel was started. Nowadays the Gellért Hotel is characterized by cosily furnished rooms in which the materials and colours of the textiles, furniture and coverings combine to radiate a sense of calm."

It was built in the 18th-century, along with the Grand Palace. The Front Palace housed the heir to the throne, who was appointed by the King; usually a son or brother of the reigning monarch who bare the title ""Second King"" or ""Vice-King"". The title of Second King started in the Ayutthaya Period, but gained a significant amount of power during the Rattanakosin Period when the Second King even got its own private army and navy. This large amount of power often led to conflicts between the King and the Second King. The last to bare the title of Second King was Prince Vichaichan. In 1884, he got into a power struggle with King Rama V in an event known as the Front Palace crisis. King Rama V tried to modernise Siam in a rapid pace, and conservative forces and the nobility, including Prince Vichaichan, saw their power and influence being slowly eroded. When Prince Vichaichan got a letter threatening his life, he mobilised up to 600 of his private troops around his palace. The King also mobilised his troops, but this only underlined that the Second King's guards were more numerous and better equipped. After an explosion, a mysterious fire broke out in the Grand Palace, threatening Wat Phra Kaeo, and the Second King's troops got on their way to the Grand Palace to try and extinguish it; however this was blocked by the King's Royal Guards who feared that the fire was orchestrated by the Second King to take over the country. Afterwards King Rama V criticised the Second King for not moving all his troops to the Grand Palace, as an ancient custom dictated that the Second King's troops must actively protect the King and the Grand Palace in an emergency. King Rama V ordered his troops to surround the Front Palace, and Prince Vichaichan fled to the British embassy. After mediation, the powerful Western countries supported King Rama V, who abolished the title and introduced the Western-style ""Crown Prince of Siam"" for the heir apparent. Prince Vichaichan died one year later. The palace was turned into the National Museum's main building housing Thai art objects. Some walled remains of the old Front Palace complex can be found inside the Thammasat University complex."

All the sides of the building are given equal value in the design. It is crowned by a high central dome, which acts as the focal point. The dome is an octagonal ribbed structure with a colossal female figure symbolizing Progress, holding a torch pointing upwards in her right hand and a spoked wheel in her left hand.

The columns of the entrance gates are crowned by figures of a lion (representing Great Britain) and a tiger (representing India). The main structure is built from a blend of India sandstone and limestone, while high-quality Italian marble was used for the key decorative elements.

The purpose of the foundation was to house the relics of St. Alexander Nevsky, patron of the newly-founded Russian capital; however, the massive silver sarcophagus of St. Alexander was relocated during Soviet times to the Hermitage, where it remains (without the relics) today. In 1797, the monastery was raised to the rank of lavra, making it only the third lavra in the Russian Church, along with Kiev Monastery of the Caves and the Trinity Monastery of Sergeyev Posad. - Here is also the site of the 'Tikhvin Cemetery' which houses the tombs of some very famous Russians: Mikhail Lomonosov, Alexander Suvorov, Nikolay Karamzin, Modest Mussorgsky, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Glinka, Natalia Goncharova and Alexander Borodin, along with others not so famous."

Many prominent classical music composers lived and worked in Vienna — most prominently, those of the First (Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Salieri) and Second (Schoenberg, Berg and Webern) Vienna Schools — and the city even today boasts famous venues like the Vienna State Opera (''Wiener Staatsoper'') and the Festival Hall (''Festsaal'') of the Hofburg Palace. It was also the birthplace of Johann Strauss II, famous for his waltzes and other dance music, as well as his operettas. Many fans of classical music consider the Vienna Philharmonic to be among the world's very best symphony orchestras. Vienna is also home to the ''Burgtheater'', the former imperial theatre of the Austro-Hungarian empire, built in 1888 to replace an older, now demolished, theatre of the same name in which Mozart premiered his famous operas ''Le nozze di Figaro'' (1786) and ''Così fan tutte'' (1790). Yet another important location in the history of classical music is the ''Theater an der Wien'', built in 1801 by the troupe for whom Mozart composed his final opera, The Magic Flute (''Die Zauberflöte'') (1791), with its Papageno Gate (''Papagenotor'') being built in honour of one of the characters in that opera. The theatre also served as the premiere venue for several famous operas such as Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' (1805) and Johann Strauss II's ''Die Fledermaus'' (1874)."

After the fall of Ayutthaya by a Burmese invasion, King Taksin commanded that the peoples who escaped had to settle down in Thonburi, the new capital of Siam. The King dictated that the Chinese group had to settle down around the area of Wat Kalayanamit, while the Portuguese people would have their houses built along the bank of the Chao Phraya River. The Portuguese had given military support to King Taksin to help him drive out the Burmese from Siam. In recognition of their support, King Taksin granted the Portuguese a plot of land for the building of a church. The first Santa Cruz Church was a wooden church built in 1770. When that church got into a state of decay, a new Chinese-style church was built here, as it was nearby the Chinese community that stayed at Wat Kalayanamit. That church was called ""Kudichin church"" (Chinese church), and the Portuguese who settled here were called ""Farang Kudichin"", which means ""Westerners at the Chinese shrine"". In 1916, the third and current Santa Cruz Church was built during the reign of King Rama IV. The church has a magnificent Italian-style architecture. The community around it still feels authentic, and is the birthplace of a famous kind of cupcake, the ""Khanom Farang Kudichin""."

The Olympic Stadium is where African-American athlete Jesse Owens won four gold medals, showing once again the fallacy of Hitler's Aryan superiority theory. It is the home of the most successful soccer/football team of Berlin, Hertha BSC, and between 2000 and 2004 was renovated for the FIFA World Cup in 2006.

By reusing time-tested architectural components, such as columns, instead of pushing forward with a genuinely modern twentieth-century, entirely new architectural concept, did they think their designs would garner more positive attention?

Kanchenjunga, the world's 3rd highest peak, is visible for much of the trek, to the north, on the Nepalese border with Sikkim. Usually the park is accessed from Maneybhanjang, approx. one hour, or 30 km. west of Darjeeling. The park can also be accessed from Rimbik, where many trekkers finish up, or from Bijanbari, with one extra day's walking. Trekkers must pay a ₹100 fee to enter the park, and must hire a guide. Porters can also be hired in Maneybhanjeng. Many trekkers sign up for a 3, 5 or 6 day trek in Darjeeling, where various trekking companies make all of the arrangements. Passports must be carried, as the trek crosses briefly into Nepal, then back into India. Sleeping bags and layered warm clothing are a must, as the temperature dips well below freezing most nights. Overnight lodging is done at assorted huts or simple guesthouses along the way, and hot meals are available at the same. Starting from Maneybhanjang, most trekkers stay overnight in Gairbas or Kalipokhari, and press on to Sandakphu for the 2nd night. Sandakphu at 3636 meters is a favorite spot to view the high Himalayan peaks of Lhotse, Everest, Makalu, etc., in early morning when visibility is good. 3 day trekkers turn aside and head downhill to Rimbik for their final night, while others head further north for spectacular views from Sabarkum and Phalut, then downhill for Raman, and finish in Rimbik for the last night. For greater cash outlay, non-trekkers, or those pressed for time can hire a jeep as transport from Maneybhanjang to Sandakphu, and stay overnight to catch the sunrise views.

Famous composers in the Papal Court have included the Renaissance masters Josquin des Prez and Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Giacomo Carissimi, a Roman composer in the early Baroque style of the early 17th century, is widely credited as being a seminal figure in the development of the oratorio, as he wrote opera-like compositions on Biblical themes for sacred concerts he directed at the Oratorio di Santissimo Crocifisso. In spite of the fact that the Church officially prohibited castration, nevertheless, due to the fact that women were banned from singing in public in the Papal States, Rome saw the rise of the castrati (men who had been castrated before they hit puberty), starting in the second half of the 16th century. From ear-witness reports, castrati were able to sing in ranges from alto to soprano like women, but with the tremendous lung power of a big man (as castrated men grow taller than non-castrated men), with the great Farinelli said to have had a tessitura from the tenor all the way up to the high soprano range, and to have been able to sing continuously for over a minute without taking a breath. The appeal of castrati spread beyond Rome to the rest of the continent (except France), with some castrati becoming sex symbols and superstars on the opera stage, such that the heroic roles in Italian Baroque operas were almost always assigned to castrati. Although technically in the Vatican, visitors to Rome can visit the Sistine Chapel where the castrati first rose to prominence, and also where the practice continued to survive long after the castrati lost their prominence on the operatic stage until Alessandro Moreschi, the last castrato, died in 1922. Today, Rome is home to the Santa Cecilia conservatory, which also hosts the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, probably Italy's best symphony orchestra other than the RAI National Symphony Orchestra, which is based in Turin."

The climb is enjoyable, providing scenic views of several other attractions and Mandalay city.   From the base of Mandalay Hill you can either climb the stairs or take a pick-up to Sutaungpyei Pagoda at the top, but the walk is probably worth it in order to catch the scenic views along the way. The climb takes about 30-45 min and requires moderate fitness, but is not overly demanding and is in the shade. Don't forget to catch the views of Kuthodaw and Sandamuni paya, and the royal palace from afar. Plenty of stray dogs, shops and other interesting stops (Buddhas, pagodas, viewpoints) line the path, such as the Gothama Buddha shrine. The two main south entrances are guarded by either Nats (spirit figures) or Chinthes (great mythical lions), but there are several other entrances.   Along the climb from the Southern stairs near the place where these pathways merge, you come across a large statue of Buddha and his kneeling disciple Ananda, who climbed this very hill two centuries before Mingdon conquered it. Buddha is seen ominously pointing towards Mandalay, indicating that after two centuries, the capital of this region would shift to Mandalay. It is this prophecy that Mingdon fulfilled.   Further up, you come across a shrine showing the various stages of a man's life - birth, youth, monk, old age and death. Interestingly, there are similarities between the birth and death stage indicating the cyclical nature of life believed by Buddhism. You can see same set of figures as an image in Shwezigon Pagoda in Bagan.  At the top, you can catch the shrine to the ogress Sandamukhi on the penultimate storey. Sandamukhi is depicted as offering her cut breasts to Buddha in a scary gesture. It is said the ogress took rebirth as King Mingdon.  In order to enter the topmost storey and see the pagoda, you must pay an additional 1000K, which you can avoid if you choose to watch the sunset from the Ogress storey. However, the open four-directional view from the top storey may be worth it, apart from the access to the washrooms in this area. Footwear is prohibited at the pagoda, which offers nice views of Mandalay and the surrounding plains. At sunset, Sutaungpyei Pagoda crowds with tourists, and many monks and other locals climb the stairs with the hope of talking to foreigners and practicing their English. Shared pick-up trucks to the base of Mandalay Hill run along 83rd St, one block from the Clock Tower, and leave every 20 minutes (500-1000K). Private pick-ups are also available (5000K). Motorbike taxis from the city center to and from the base of Mandalay Hill run between 1000-2000 K. Try not to come down by an obscure entrance to a less crowded area, from where it will become very hard to catch a taxi."

The mosque has three domes, which have kept the traditional corrugated galvanised iron shape of the old mosque and two minarets. The domes are decorated with the green and turquoise mirrors, which are bordered with gilded inscriptions from Qur'an.

Fort Wayne was built when Canada was seeking independence from Britain. The United States wanted to remain neutral on the case, but realized that they lacked fortifications along the northern border to repel a potential British attack. The Army named the new fort for Revolutionary War hero General Anthony Wayne, who took possession of Detroit from the British in 1796. Before any cannon had been installed at the newly-constructed Fort Wayne, the United States and Britain peacefully resolved their differences, eliminating the need for a fort on the Detroit River. Fort Wayne remained unused for a decade after its initial construction. But it was once again used during the Civil War because the British supported the Confederacy. For the rest of the Civil War, the fort served as a mustering center for troops from Michigan, as well as a place for veterans to recover from their wounds. After the Civil War and until 1920, Fort Wayne served as a garrison post. Today, the fort is operated by the Detroit Recreation Department."

It has been restored to provide the most unique accommodations in the Capital District. Voted ""Best in the Capital /Saratoga Region"", The Morgan State House is an inn in the European tradition. It is centrally located in downtown Albany, on a quiet, tree-lined residential street overlooking Washington Park and was the longtime home of the artist and suffragette Alice Morgan Wright (1881&mdash;1975), who lived here from 1888 (when she was 7 years old) until her death. The house was designed by R.W. Gibson, the architect of the Cathedral of All Saints, for her father, Henry Romeyn Wright, who made a fortune in dry goods during the Civil War. The multiple peaked gables and intricate interior details reflect the Japanese-influenced aesthetic of the 1880s. Alice Morgan Wright was a leading figure in the American suffrage movement and once was jailed in London with Emmeline Pankhurst. In 1921 she helped found the New York League of Women’s Voters. An influential artist of the Art Deco style, Wright maintained a studio on the fourth floor of the house, and her works can be found in museums and private collections throughout the country."

The oldest Mevlevi lodge in Istanbul, the convent was started in 1491, when the surrounding area was, hard to believe today but, pure wilderness beyond the city walls of Galata, although the current building dates back to 1855, which took its shape after many repairs, rebuildings, and fires. However, the lodge was shut down in the early years of the republic (in 1925) along with all other 'reactionary' movements in Turkey, and the building has been serving as a museum dedicated to the Mevlevi order since 2010. Downstairs is a series of rooms dealing with the daily life of an average dervish, with informational signs in Turkish and English about the history of Islam and the Mevlevi order (also notice the original wooden pillars that support the building on this floor). On the upper floor is a dancing hall, a perfect example of 19th century Ottoman Baroque, where ''sema'' dervish ceremonies are held (once or twice every week at nights, an extra 45 TL—buy tickets in advance, as space is limited). On the third floor is a display of various traditional Turkish/Islamic arts, including paper marbling (''ebru''), and calligraphy. After exiting the building, check out the small graveyard (or the ""silent house"" as the sign at its entrance says) on one side of the building, shaded by a number of hackberry trees, which Ottomans favoured to plant in the yards of mosques and graves to sign holiness.

Recent researches have shown that the architectural plan and even the structure of the monument combine all the characteristic features of the religious architecture of that epoch. The monastery underwent major repairs in 1564, through the generosity of Princess Zamfira, the daughter of Moise Voivode, who ruled over Walachia between 1529 and 1530. After her father had fallen in the battle of Viisoara that had taken place in 1530, the princess took refuge in the province of Transylvania, where she settled down and got married. She was entombed in this monastery. In 1762, General Bukow set fire to the monastic establishment, causing serious damage to it. Over the succeeding centuries it was renovated many times. Although the monastery has been a focus for the spiritual life of the Romanians beyond the Carpathian Mountains and had a great historical significance, it was closed down as a result of the Governmental Ordinance no 410/1959, issued on the orders of the communist authorities. In 1973, a monk settled on the premises and tried to revive the monastic life of this place. In 1976, through the persevering efforts of the ever-memorable Father Arsenie Boca and of Mother Zamfira Constantinescu, the holy establishment was reopened and served as a convent. After 1990, conservation, consolidation and restoration activities have been carried out within the monastery. A theological school for training both young female resident monastic and lay young women has also been accommodated in the monastery. In June 1992, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church decided to canonize Venerable Ioan of Prislop, who was one of the most outstanding representatives of the Romanian monasticism at the end of the 14th century. Antonie Plamadeala, Metropolitan of Ardeal, took religious vows and entered the monastic life in this very monastery. The holy establishment also shelters a monastic theological seminary."

Camping overnight on Acatenango lets you watch the spectacular explosions of the active Fuego volcano from your camp site. There are several routes up the Acatenango. The most popular one starts near La Soledad (about 2400m). A much longer one starts from Alotenango. In early 2016 there was no fee to enter the Acatenango area but there used to be a Q50 fee per person. Overnight tours are best done when Fuego is very active. You can watch the [http://www.insivumeh.gob.gt/geofisica/vulcanologia/boletin%20formato.htm daily activity reports] and some [http://ovfuego-norte.geo.mtu.edu/ webcams] to plan your trip.

You can also contact a local guide directly which will usually charge Q200-Q300. Guides are easily found in La Soledad. Camping equipment can be rented in Antigua from O.X. or Old Town Outfitters but is relatively pricey. You can also go without a guide. There are several trail that are often not obvious but easily followed with a GPS and, e.g., the trail maps from [http://osm.org/go/S7psEGV4-- OpenstreetMaps]. To get to the trail head, take a bus from Antigua to Parramos and from Parramos to La Soledad (or take a taxi from Antigua, Q300.) The trail starts just before you reach La Soledad. There might be people selling drinks on the trail but there are usually no water sources. There are two popular camp sites half way up Acatenango. Both give you beautiful views of Fuego at night. The hike up from the western camp site to the top of Acatenango is much easier than from the eastern site. However, running down on the loose gravel to the eastern site is much more fun than going down on the west. To get the best of both sites, camp on the western site climb the peak with your gear and hike down to the eastern site."

There is the combination of sumptuous ornamentation with rigorously classicizing monumentality. The palace takes its name from its opulent decoration in a wide variety of polychrome marbles. A rough-grained Finnish granite on the ground floor is in subtle contrast to polished pink Karelian marble of the pilasters and white Urals marble of capitals and festoons. Panels of veined bluish gray Urals marble separate the floors, while Tallinn dolomite was employed for ornamental urns. In all, 32 disparate shades of marble were used to decorate the palace. - The plan of the edifice is trapezoidal: each of its four facades, though strictly symmetrical, has a different design. The palace court is dominated by a sturdy equestrian statue of Alexander III of Russia,- or Alexander Alexandrovich Romanov (10 Mar 1845–1 Nov 1894) who was Emperor of Russia, King of Poland and Grand Prince of Finland,- the most famous work of sculptor Paolo Troubetzkoy; formerly it graced the obelisk's spot at Vosstanya Square, before the Moscow Railway Station. In 1843, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich decided to redecorate the edifice, renaming it Constantine Palace. An adjacent church and other outbuildings were completely rebuilt, while the interior of the palace was refurbished in keeping with the eclectic tastes of its new owner. Only the main staircase and the Marble Hall survived that refacing and still retain the refined stucco work and elaborate marble pattern of Rinaldi's original decor. - Former Lenin Museum, '''now''', the palace accommodates permanent exhibitions of the Russian State Museum, notably ""Foreign Artists in Russia (18th and 19th centuries)"" and the ""Peter Ludwig Museum at the Russian Museum"", featuring canvases by Andy Warhol and other Pop Art idols."

The Saturday begins with a colourful dance procession from the Guildhall to Parliament Square, before the teams separate to dance on site, in King’s Square and St Sampson’s Square throughout the day before a final grand show in front of dignitaries. The Sunday dancing is less formal, taking place in St Sampson’s and King’s Square on the Sunday morning. Over the years we have had representatives of all the leading traditional team styles: the stick and hanky Morris of the Cotswolds, the large clog-stepping sides of the North West, the intricate weaving Yorkshire Longsword, the country-dance like East Anglian Molly, the bizarre costumes and disguises of Welsh border Morris and the swift interlacing of Northumbrian Rapper sword. This year’s Festival details are to be confirmed. We'll be inviting teams from all round England to join in this celebration of English Traditional dance, hosted by local team Ebor Morris. The two other local sides Acorn Morris & Minster strays should be in attendance, together hopefully with old favourites such as Brackley Morris from Northamptonshire."

The beach on the northeast side of the peninsula is almost completely empty for over 10 kilometres. Just leave your motorbike anywhere you like on the side of the highway and scramble over the 300-metre wide sand dunes to reach the coast. Take off your shoes and enjoy: in dry season, the pale-yellow to crystal-white sand squeaks pleasantly underfoot. Small sand hills line the coast; those who manage to scale their slippery heights are rewarded with views of the mountains in the north and of the never-ending coast stretching off to the horizon in the south. There are no stores and no shade, so be sure to take water and lots of sunscreen.  In contrast to the rolling sand dunes of the northern part of the peninsula, the shore at Bãi Kỳ Co in the south-central area is sharply framed by rocky boulders and stunning cliffs. Jump from the 10-metre (30-foot) cliffs into the clear blue ocean, play in pools of fresh water trapped amongst the inland boulders, swim in salt water lakes connected by underwater passageways to the ocean, hop in a wooden boat for a one-hour jaunt with fishermen to explore the islands just off the coast, or scramble up the jagged cliffs closest to the shore for perfect photo opportunities of the ocean and coast. If you're really adventurous, hike the trail through the mountain forests: the three-hour trek from the top down to the beach takes you through spectacular boulder passes and mountain creeks. And anywhere you are, you can't miss the largest Buddha statue in Vietnam, the 30-metre (100-foot) golden statue constructed in 2014 of Avalokiteśvara, the embodiment of infinite compassion of all Buddhas, looking out over the water.  But '''Bãi Kỳ Co is changing rapidly''': after years of plans deferred and broken, luxury development finally began at the end of 2015. An 18-hole golf course drafted by Jack Nicklaus's design company had a partial opening in February, 2016 and is the anchor of Hanoi-based FLC Group's drive to build Vietnam's first seven-star luxury resort in the area around Eo Gió beach. So enjoy the area while it's still in its natural state... and still open to the public.   The mountains on the mainland just to the north of the peninsula have several attractions which are popular with local Bình Định tourists. One kilometre north on Highway 640 past the junction with Highway 19 is the Buddhist Temple Chùa Ông Núi. Founded in 1702, the temple sits on the mountain to the west of the highway and has '''stunning views of the coast and the ocean'''. Near the temple closer to the shore is a massive stone and metal sculpture which commemorates the capture of Bình Định by People's Army's forces in March, 1975. Behind the cafe on the road opposite the sculpture, a steep boulder walkway carries an odd mix of selfie-shooting locals and gruff fishermen down to a picturesque cove crammed with round wooden trawlers sandwiched between the water and the cliffs. [[File:Thi Nai bridge.jpg|left|thumb|Thị Nại bridge]] The easiest way to explore the peninsula from Quy Nhơn is to rent a motorbike and drive over via the Thị Nại bridge. From the city centre, take Nguyễn Tất Thành to Trần Hưng Đạo. At the large intersection, head north on Võ Nguyên Giáp. You'll cross four small bridges as you pass through industrial parks and agricultural fields on all sides. After three kilometres, the road bends east and you'll see the 2.5-kilometre long Thị Nại bridge stretching forlornly across the sea. At least, hopefully you'll see it: the crossing is notorious for being covered in fog and strong winds even when the city is sunny, so take care when on the bridge not to get blown over by the gusts of air, water and sand. After reaching the peninsula and passing a petrol station on the right, you'll reach a confusing series of roundabouts; most head to factories and the not-yet developed areas, so be careful to follow the signs for Highway 19B. Once you're on Highway 19B, it's a straight line north for 20 km (12 mi) to the top of the peninsula."

Sagaing Hill can be included as well. You can visit U Bein Bridge twice: Once during the day and once at sunset. Start early at the Clock Tower in Mandalay (26th Street, 84th Street) and cycle south 84th Street till two streets after the 42th street. The road will then split into 2, go left. After the next bend you will see the entrance to Maha Muni Image. Lock your bicycle and take your time to explore the temple and the gardens behind.  :Go back to where the 84th Street splits into two and this time go right. Continue further south. Parallel to your street runs another, getting really close to yours after about 3 km, only to then turn right when yours goes gradually left (there is a gas station, 100 m to your left is a white pagoda). From there continue on the main road. After 400 m the road bends right, then continues straight for about 1km and then bends left. You can stop there to visit the Burkayar Monastery. Afterwards, continue straight and leave the main road. After 500 m the railway tracks cross the street. Continue straight through the neighbourhoods for 500 m more until you reach the Taungthaman Lake. Follow the road counter-clockwise along the lake and after 2 km you will reach the parking area of U Bein Bridge. You might have to pay a small parking fee (MMK 100-200). Cross the Bridge and settle in a teahouse on the other side.   :Get back on the bicycle and go west until you hit the main road (Sagaing-Mandalay Expy) and the tracks. From there you can explore the neighbourhoods and stop by any building where you hear the dominant rattling noise of the looms. There are factory-like businesses and private homes with only one or two machines. There are plenty. And you will be warmly welcomed to any of them to have a look.   :To go to Innwa follow the main road (Saging-Mandalay Expy) further south for 4..5 km, always straight until you reach a roundabout. Go straight for Innwa (or turn right and cross the bridge to Sagaing). After another kilometre you will reach a crossing. The main road bends right a little and crosses the river to Sagaing, a smaller road bends sharply left to somewhere else. And straight continues a small street of rather poor condition. Take this small street and follow it for another kilometre until you reach the river. You can only cross it by ferry (1min).

The busy road connecting Sopianae and Mursa (today - Eszék) ran under the hill, and the spring there served as a place for a rest for travellers. First a statue of Mary was erected, later the Christian Slavs placed an altar of Mary to here. In the 11th century a chapel was built in honour of Mary. The two towered, baroque Roman Catholic church built was built in the 18th century, by Franciscan monks. The former church was a wooden church in Árpád-period (probably in 1148, King Géza II), which burned down in the Turkish period (end of 15th century or early 16th century). In medieval times it was turned into a Protestant place of worship by the lord of Siklós Fortress, Péter Perényi. Due to the frequent prayers and Marian apparitions of the 17th-century, it has long been a place of pilgrimage. The church is a Minor Basilica since 2008. East of the devotional church you can find the Holy Well, the water of which was taken home by the pilgrims in the famous jugs of Gyűd. A feast is held here on every Mary's day and on the important religious holidays, i.e. 25-27 times annually. This time the church and its vicinity is visited by many people, the number of which was nearly 500,000 in the past few years. Máriagyűd is endpoint of the (El Camino-like) Pilgrimage Way which based on the Hungarian cultural traditions. The ''Pilgrimage Way'' is 420km long, start at Esztergom and on the way to here connect up the holy places of the country. One of the largest and most popular place of pilgrimage for Hungary. - This is also the starting point of the Butcher's Broom - educational path (Csodabogyó tanösvény)."

The site has been identified as ancient Shechem, known from Egyptian and biblical references. Tell Balata was an important cultural and political centre due to its strategic location at the eastern end of a pass between Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal. It was overlooking the plain of Askar and commanded all traffic through the area. It was also a centre for agriculture and trade, it has been called “the uncrowned queen of Palestine”. The archaeological evidence on the history on the site is the result of German and American excavation during the 20th century. It shows that Tell Balata was first settled in the Chalcolithic period (c.4000- 3500 BC) and developed into a city during the Middle and Late Bronze Age. The site was used again during the Iron Age and throughout the Hellenistic times until the 1st century BC. After the Hellenistic times the focus of the settlement shifted further west to the newly established Roman town of Flavia Neapolis, now known as Nablus. Tell Balata is a potential World Heritage Site as part of ""Old Town Nablus and its environs"". At the moment the site is being developed by a joined Palestinian-Dutch project, in cooperation with UNESCO, into Tell Balata Archaeological Park.

The old katholikon of St. Nicholas (later destroyed by the Soviets) was built in the 16th century, rebuilt in 2003 . The Ugreshi Monastery was one of the walled abbeys defending approaches to the Russian capital from the south. - A late legend attributes its foundation to Dmitry Donskoy who, on his way to the Kulikovo Field, is supposed to have made a stay there and determined to give a decisive battle to the Tatars after seeing an image of St. Nicholas in a pious dream for this reason founded here the monastery. - Tsar Alexis habited here several times a year. - The great katholikon (main church) of the monastery was built to a Russian-Byzantine design by Alexander Kaminsky between 1880 and 1894.

The position of the tower follows the ancient ideal of ""golden mean"". Located on the pretty main square of the city, it is a good orientation point. The Old City Hall was built 1556 by Hieronymus Lotter on basements of two Patrician houses. It is a beautiful Renaissance style building, 90 meters long with arcades (1906–09), six gables and a tower. In the 18th century the tower was enlarged and it received a Baroque spire. Until 1904 the Old City Hall was home of the city administration. Then it became home of the city museum. Most impressive is the huge Banquetting Hall with Renaissance interior (open fireplaces). Many fine works of medieval religious art: altars, paintings, wood-carved sculptures etc. Most of them were saved from churches which were deconstructed in Leipzig's surrounding. Very impressive are the rooms with interior from old Patrician houses. Also interesting: the treasure chamber (steep and narrow staircase!). This Renaissance building was erected in just nine months in 1556–57 under the direction of the architect Hieronymus Lotter. The municipal government moved into the New Town Hall in 1909. If you have a bit of luck you are allowed to visit the cellar of the building. Here you find the chamber of torture and the jail. Leipzig's Renaissance City hall contains a museum of city history which possesses the original of the only confirmed painting of Bach produced in his lifetime. It contains interesting information regarding the public executions that previously took place in the market in front of the city hall. The most famous execution was that of Woyzeck later made famous by the Büchner play and the opera of Alban Berg. The interior of the Old City Hall (built in 1556) is far more interesting than the outside view. Inside there's an interesting museum covering the history of Leipzig from the very beginnings (in the 12th century) till our days. One of the most touristy places of the whole city."

Those carrying the canopy with the statue of the saint sprint up the steep slopes that lead from the ring road from the church to Piazza Duomo, where they are greeted by thunderous applause from the crowd while a hail of fireworks descends from the Castello della Rocca to meet them. St. Justin, the second patron of Fabrica di Roma, is brought out on 22  September every five years in a casket with a wax body and relics, and is celebrated with the same solemn transportation as San Matteo: the same rituals, the same brotherhood of porters who lead him on the path between the historic centre and Via Roma, to the Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Within days of the festivities is the running of the carts that takes place the day of the patron saint in the middle of the afternoon and takes place on Via San Giorgio, where carts made by hand by the participants descend the ring road at breakneck speed from the church to Via Roma."

The oldest surviving buildings are from the mid 13th century, but the area was a royal residence from the late 11th century. The fortress is situated close to the international ferry terminal. The royal hall, Håkonshallen, (Haakon's Hall), named for King Haakon Haakonsson, was built some time between 1247 and 1261. It is used today for royal galas, as a banqueting hall for the city council, and other public events. The roof is reconstructed after a blast during World War II. The nearby Rosenkrantz tower has the same appearance as it had in the 16th century. The oldest part of the tower dates back to the 1270s, a few decades after Håkonshallen. It was expanded in the 1560s by the governor, Erik Rosenkrantz, to its present shape. The rest of the medieval buildings in the fortress have been replaced or demolished over the centuries, with some ruins still visible. Among these is the medieval cathedral, the Church of Christ, which was used for coronation and as a royal burial site in the 13th century. A memorial marks the site of the high altar. Guided tours of the royal hall and the tower start every hour between 10AM and 4PM every day from 15 May to 31 Aug in the royal hall. From 1 Sept to 14 May tours are only available between noon and 3PM on Sundays. Entrance fee is kr. 40 for adults, 20 for students and free for children under 16. A small cafeteria with coffee, tea and basic snacks is open from June to August. The fortress grounds serve as a city park; you can hang out here and eat that fish you just bought at the nearby fish market - or just enjoy the sunshine and the view. The park is popular among locals and tourists, but usually not crowded. It is normally not a problem to find a good spot for your picnic or a round of Frisbee. There is a very good view of the bay. The use of open fire, including barbecues, and the drinking of alcoholic beverages are forbidden. Unlike in many other parks, the prohibition of alcohol is enforced strictly here, as the fort is still a military area with occasional military guards on patrol."

Its two summits used to be separated by the Setun River, until one of the summits was razed in 1987. Since 1936, the area has been part of Moscow and now contains the '''Victory Park''' with many tanks and other vehicles used in the Second World War on display. Historically, the hill had great strategic importance, as it commanded the best view of the Russian capital. Its name is derived from the Russian for ""to bow down"", as everyone approaching the capital from the west was expected to do homage here. In 1812, it was the spot where Napoleon in vain expected the keys to the Kremlin to be brought to him by Russians. - Out of the Victory Park, there is the '''War museum''' /see above/. - In the 1960s, started to use this area as an open-air museum dedicated to the Russian victory over Napoleon. The New Triumphal Arch, erected in wood in 1814 and in marble in 1827, was relocated and reconstructed here in 1968. A loghouse, where Kutuzov presided over the Fili conference which decided to abandon Moscow to the enemy, was designated a national monument. The huge panorama ""Battle of Borodino"" (1910–12) was installed here in 1962. In the 1990s an obelisk was added with a statue of Nike and a monument of St George slaying the dragon. The obelisk's height is exactly 141,8 meters, which is 10 cm for every day of the War.

Swami Vivekananda on his return from the west was requested by the devotees in Madras (now Chennai) to start a Math here. To fulfill their desire Swamiji sent his brother-disciple Swami Ramakrishnananda to Madras in March 1897. After reaching Madras, the first thing Swami Ramakrishnananda did was to set up a small shrine for Sri Ramakrishna at a rented house. He lived there and led a life of renunciation, service and austerities. Slowly he built up the institution as the present Sri Ramakrishna Math and thus Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, came into existence. This is the oldest centre of the Ramakrishna Order in the South. Srimat Swami Bhuteshanandaji Maharaj, the 12th President of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, laid the foundation-stone for this Universal Temple on 1 December 1994 in a grand function. It took five years for the project to take shape as the present grand Universal Temple. ''On 7 Feb 2000 the temple was dedicated by Srimat Swami Ranganathanandaji Maharaj'', the 13th President of the Ramakrishna Order. ''Sri Ramakrishna Math completed hundred years of its service in 1997.'' The Math is regarded for its spiritual traditions, modern outlook, acceptance of all religions, service as the way of life.

The collection shows off works, most of them Belgian, from the 14th to the 20th century, starting in the historical section, with Hans Memling's portraits from the late 15th century, which are marked by sharp lifelike details, works by Hiëronymus Bosch, and Lucas Cranach's Adam and Eve. You should particularly seek out the subsequent rooms featuring Pieter Brueghel, including his Adoration of the Magi. Don't miss his unusual Fall of the Rebel Angels, with grotesque faces and beasts. But don't fear, many of Brueghel's paintings, like those depicting Flemish village life, are of a less fiery nature. Later artists represented include Rubens, Van Dyck, Frans Hals, and Rembrandt. Next door, in a circular building connected to the main entrance, the modern art section has an emphasis on underground works - if only because the museum's eight floors are all below ground level.

The scene was never the same after Prohibition, though, and that's something Tim Herzog aims to change — when his Flying Bison Brewing Company opened in 2000 in Riverside, it was the first locally-based brewery to operate in Buffalo since '''Iroquois''' closed its doors twenty-eight years earlier. Fast-forward to November 2014, when they moved to a bigger, purpose-built facility in burgeoning Larkinville, and Tim Herzog has come a long way toward fulfilling his dream of making Buffalo a brewing center once again. Locals are nearly unanimous in praise of the solid beers produced at Flying Bison — ""Aviator Red"", Buffalo's best-selling red ale, the Vienna-style ""Rusty Chain"", and seasonal offerings like the holiday favorite ""Blizzard Bock"". Best of all, Flying Bison's hyperlocal focus and commitment to the community is unwavering: they donate spent grain for use as animal feed on area farms, and labeling, bottle production, and other operations are contracted to Buffalo-based companies whenever possible. There's also a retail shop on site, where beer is sold three days a week, on draught and in bottles, from some of the friendliest folks you'll ever meet.

Shri Mahalakshmi is the consort of Shri Vishnu and it is said that they both reside in the Karveer area. Mahalakshmi also known as Goddess Ambabai enjoys status of one of the important spiritual centers in India. Construction of the temple was initiated in 7th century by Chalukya rulers and further beautified by Yadavas till 9th Century AD.

At 12:30AM, worship with fragrant flowers & Kumkum is done for the devotees camphor is burnt and 'Naivedya' (Rich dishes) is offered.

It is also called 'Dar-al-Akhyre (The Other World). ''Ajmad Sanjar'' (1085-1157) was sultan of the Great Seljuq Empire. He was one of the last great Seljuk and was described as brave, generous and chivalrous, a perfect Iranized Turk, defender of the Persian civilization and one of its legendary heroes. At the time of the division of the reign among the sons of Malkikshah he became governor of Khurasan at the age of ten or twelve. His principal residence was Merv. He installed vassal rulers in Transoxania and Afghanistan and became lord of an extensive sultanate in the Iranian East. In 1141, however, Transoxania was conquered by the Kara-Khitai, who had migrated from China to the Issyk Kul. In 1153 tribes of Oghuz rebelled against Sanjar, took him prisoner and plundered Merv. Sanjar could free himself 3 years later only and died in 1157. Finally, Sanjar had failed to create a lasting Seljuk state in the Iranian east. During the siege of Merv by the Mongols in 1221 the body of the sultan was reburied in an unknown place. The mausoleum was constructed by order of Sultan Muizeddin Sanjar. Due to the fine brickwork, the carved stucco and the surviving mural paintings it is one of the most outstanding buildings of the Seljuk period."

Typical start time is 09:00 and you will need a reasonable level of fitness since you will ramble along one of the district's green lanes, surrounded by wild flowers and laughing children, gaining about 280 m (800&nbsp;ft) as you ascend a ridge until you have an exhilarating view of Lake Mutanda spread out below you. There's then quite a steep scramble down to reach the lake shore below. There is a particular promontory here where the village inhabitants believe that serpents are the spiritual throne of their ancestors - consequently the snakes here have found a kind of sanctuary amongst the Yam beds and sugar cane. You are likely to see deadly black mambas, 5 m (16&nbsp;ft) long rock pythons, spitting cobras and, possibly, green mambas. When you've seen enough, a dugout canoe will pick you up and skirt the reed beds so you can admire kingfishers and other water birds. USD25 per person; discount for groups by negotiation.<br />If you're a lazy muzungo, they also offer 3-day game drive safaris in air-conditioned 4x4s taking up to 3 people per vehicle into the southern part of the Queen Elizabeth National Park's Ishasha sector where you will almost invariably see the famous pride of tree-climbing lions. For this game drive, you'll leave Kisoro at 06:00 and first travel to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, arriving about 08:00 to try to spot forest elephants, chimpanzees and, very occasionally, the rare and elusive L'Hoest's monkey (''Cercopithecus lhoesti''). Generally you will not leave the safety of your 4x4 because of the danger from giant forest pigs which can grow up to 2.1 m (6.9&nbsp;ft) in length and can tip the scales at more than 270 kg (60&nbsp;lb). Leaving Bwindi about 11:00, the next stop is lunch at Kihihi trading post. After lunch there is an hour's drive before you can check-in to your bandas in the Q.E.N.P. to have a shower and freshen up. You start your game drive about 16:00 until dusk around 19:00. The next morning kicks off with another game drive from 06:30 towards the Ishasha river. Here you'll be able to get some fantastic close-ups of hippo just a few metres below where you'll be standing on the steep bank (hippos are neither good at climbing nor leaping). After breakfast you'll be driven to Mweya for a 2 hour afternoon boat cruise on the Kazinga Channel that connects Lakes George and Edward. After disembarkation, there follows another game drive with likely sightings of Uganda kob, water buck, warthogs, water buffalo, elephant. If you're lucky, you may spot leopard. That night is spent in the White House hotel in Kasese. The next morning is spent visiting about a dozen of the more than forty volcanic crater lakes in the vicinity of Fort Portal. After lunch, the afternoon is spent visiting some of the historic sights of the Toro Kingdom."

The fort's military history is best known for it's central role in the defense of the country in the War of 1812, simply named the Battle of Fort McHenry. At the time, Baltimore was the industrial powerhouse of the United States, and was a critical producer of ships and armaments. While of lesser importance in future wars, Fort McHenry remained relevant: a prison for captured Confederate soldiers in the Civil War, a military hospital during WWI, and again an active Coast Guard base during WWII. Since 1925 it has been designated as a National Park (and since 1939 doubly listed as a National Monument), and is today a museum, with plenty of cannons and nooks and crannies to explore. Back to the National Anthem, its Francis Scott Key, who was escaped here from British captivity in the War of 1812, joins Edgar Allen Poe, Thurgood Marshall, and H L Mencken as a preeminent icon of the city and the eponym for dishes at restaurants, bridges, and one impressive golden statue in Bolton Hill. He might be a little sad to see that the flag is ''not'' still there. It was getting extra raggedy after all these years, and was moved to the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. for preservation."

He is one of the prime witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus. St. Thomas Mount is associated with St. Thomas, the apostle of Christ, who is believed to have been martyred here. The mount is commonly called in Tamil ""Parangi Malai"" or ""Bhringi Malai'.History says 2000 years ago, a saint 'Parangi' lived here ('parangi' in Tamil language is used to refer to a white person). According to local myth, St. Thomas was one of the first Christians to reach India and to preach Christianity. He is believed to have reached South India in AD 52, and spent the last years of his life in a cave on this hill. Tradition states that Thomas was assassinated by an arrow in AD 72, by persons hostile to him. Thus, the hillock acquired the name St. Thomas Mount. Over time Anglo-Indians predominated in this area. A small relic-filled Church built in 1523 by the Portuguese stands at the summit of the 300 feet high St. Thomas Mount. The place was visited by Pope John Paul II during his visit to India on 5 February 1986. At the northern foot of the mount, is a gateway of four impressive arches surmounted by a cross bearing the inscribed date 1547. A flight of 160 steps leads up to the summit of the mount. There are fourteen stations of the cross erected on the way to the summit."

There are many kms of isolated and beatuful beaches to enjoy. It features as it's centrepoint Fingal Head, a volcanic rock headland originally named Point Danger by James Cook in 1770. Subsequently the headland north of the tweed River Mouth was incorrectly named Point Danger, so if you have a fetish for Cook's place names on the East Coast of Australia, this is the Point Danger you must visit. The name Fingal was chosen because of the hexagonal columns of volcanic rock. These were originally a lava finger from the shield volcano, the plug of which is Mount Warning, also named by Cook. Similar rock formations exist in Northern Ireland at Fingal, thus the name. A prominent rock formation off the point is accessed by a small surf affected causeway, and this is named Giants Causway, also with Northern Irish connections. The surf beach on the northern side is patrolled in summer holidays and weekends. Foreign visitors should remember that inexperience in the surf can lead to trouble, so even if there are others body surfing, it is not a sign that the conditions are benign. In other words, stick to the patrolled beaches. There is a very loyal board surfer fraternity usually finding a wave on the south side of the headland. The camping ground at the main beach offers demountables, van and tent sites. The nearest pub is the Chinderah, on the river on the western side of the highway, once the ferry crossing point for all coastal road traffic. The island off the coast is Cook Island, as it was first mentioned, but not named, by Cook. Dive boats use this for charter dives from Tweed Heads, although you might also make an arranged pick up from the small river marina you pass as you enter Fingal. Camping, or overnight staying is not permitted in the Tweed Shire and this is actively enforced. Also nude bathing is prohibited, and police cars do patrol the beaches, so watch out. There is community concern about undesirable types hanging about, rather than concerns about nudity."

The popular Hungarian king, Mátyás, held both of his weddings here, and so it is known as the Matthias Church. Today an eclectic mix of styles, the church was started in the thirteenth century. The main apse, which ends in a seven-sided polygon, is in French style and is the earliest extant section. The central section was built about 100 years later. During the Turkish occupation of Budapest, all the furnishings were removed and the painted walls whitewashed to cover art unacceptable to the Islamic eye. Once returned to the Catholic community, it was Baroquified (i.e. covered with Baroque ornamentation that obscured the original style like many other Central European churches were), and the rose window was bricked up. In the last century, between 1873 and 1896, Frigyes Schulek began a major renovation and restoration of the Matthias Church. -The '''interior''' is sumptuously decorated in a style which is on the one hand art deco and yet evokes the medieval predecessors of this structure. As you enter the church turn to the right and proceed down the right hand aisle to the front of the church. For a small fee you can visit the underground treasury which includes a replica of the Crown of St. Stephen -- the real crown (a 12th century object even though Stephen was a 10th century king) is on display in the parliament building.

Today, only ruins are left owing to the fact that the main construction material was clay-bricks. Often referred to as ''The Pompeii of Central Asia'', it is well worth a visit. Duplicates of old Sogdian art are exposed in the nearby museum. The director will also take you on a tour, which will open your eyes to many interesting details which will normally escape the layman's eye.  Ancient Panjakent was divided into a '''shakhrestan (residential quarter)''' covering an area of about 13 hectares, an '''ark (citadel)''' with a palace, covering an area of 1 ha, a '''rabat (suburb pulular district)''' and a '''necropolis'''. The site is huge. Located on the top of a hill, it offers amazings views over the entire valley. The living quarters and fortress were separated by a narrow wadi with a bridge connecting the two parts of the city.   Two ''temples'' in the shakhrestan formed the center of the urban area. The two temples contained statues and mural paintings. During the 5th and 6th centuries, no building in Panjakent was as magnificent as the two temples and even the houses of the wealthiest residents seemed rather humble compared to the two temples.   The buildings were made of mud bricks and paksha. The '''residential houses''' ranged from single room buildings to large estates, reflecting the social status of their inhabitants. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the hoses of the rich dominated the architecture of the city. At the beginning of the 8th century, the spaces between the houses were converted into passageways and often covered with vaults. The houses of the rich became two-story buildings with vaults over the room on the first floor. All residential houses were covered with wall paintings and woodcarvings.   The larger houses consisted of ''halls'' with four columns and benches along the walls. They were the most important part of the houses and served religious purposes. More than a third of the hoses had such ''reception halls''. It is here where the archeologists discovered many exceptional ''mural paintings''. These paintings date from the 5th to the 8th century and are considered the most important works of early medieval art in Central Asia before the arrival of Islam. Most houses had a dark vaulted room for storage and a spiral staircase leading to the living quarters in the second floor. The houses of the well-to-do population usually had a room with a fire altar and a ceremonial hall decorated with wall paintings and wood carvings. In the main hall, there was a ''niche'' up to 4 m widr opposite the entrance with giant images of tutelary gods and small pictures of the praying members of the household. The center of the hall was marked by four wooden columns which supported complex wooden structures with a dome on a square foundation on the top. The hall was decorated with woodcarvings in high relief and even with small statues of caryatids and atlantes. The most common motif of the reliefs in the ceiling were arched niches with figures of the gods, including the sun-god in his chariot. The wall paintings on the other three walls were much smaller than the gods facing the main entrance. They formed two or three friezes depicting royal feasts, hunting scenes, the heroic deeds of ''Rostam'', local heroes, amazons or persons from the Indian epic Mahabarata. The layout of the Sogdian central hall is unique. The decorations show that the Sogdian artist were familiar with the artistic and literary traditions of different cultures, as Persia, Greece and even India.   The majority of the population observed some local variation of ''Zoroastrianism'', which is proved by the wide distribution of ossuary funerals and fire-altars. There is, however, some evidence of the presence of Christianity and Buddhism and eventually even of the cult of Shiva. Zoroastrianism was combined with cults of additional gods and goddesses. Not all of these deities were of Iranian origin, as can be seen from the cult of the Mesopotamian goddess Nana.   The iconography of these goods can be traced back to the Hellenistic period, e.g. the image of a defeated goddess. It was also influenced by Sasanian ideas of the royal attributes of gods and observed some Hinduistic features as well. The iconography took its final form in the 5th and 6th centuries. Each household had its own divine protector, but all gods formed part of a single pantheon, as can be seen from wall paintings depicting several deities side by side. The three-headed god of the wind ''Veshparkar'', who resembles Shiva, and the four-handed ''Nana'' riding on a lion or seated on a throne in the shape of a lion can easily be recognized. Altogether, more than 20 deities can be found on small terracotta images, murals, woodcarvings and clay figurines. The images of Nana, a god sitting on a throne in the shape of a camel and of a god standing over a fallen demon are most common."

Each year, millions of visitors come to walk (13 million in 2006). 40,000 years ago, nomadic populations were established near the forest. Around the year 1000, the forest was composed of a series of enclaves that shared little lords and wealthy landowners . For the kings of France, the forest had indeed many uses including hunting and a military interest. In 1400, Charles VI ordered the first amendment of the forest. Under Francis I, the forest consisted of only 13 365 ha but the Kings expanded it through acquisitions and forfeitures. It was at this time the management of the forest and administration took shape and was kept until the Revolution. At the time of Louis XIV, less than 20% of the area was forested. Colbert launched a new reformation in 1664 replanting the sites. The king then traverses the forest each year in the fall for hunting. In 1716, after the terrible winter of 1709, a new forest management was enacted: 6000 ha were planted with deciduous trees, but this was an almost total failure. A new development was revived in 1750. In 1786, a shy introduction of Scots pine is attempted. In 1750, around 90 km from the forest is bounded by 1050 terminals still visible today. After the Revolution, after many deep cuts and proliferation of game misconduct hunting Napoleon in 1807 reformed the forest administration and the castle. In 1830, the planting of 6,000 ha of other pine angered artists who seek inspiration in the forest. In 1839, Claude-François Denecourt released its first guide forest walks and trails the first landscape in 1842 In 1849 the railway arrived at Fontainebleau, which will allow Parisians to visit Fontainebleau by day trips . In 1861 was created the first artistic reserve 1097 ha. It is the first nature reserve in the world, even before the creation of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. In 1953, the first biological reserves were created."

It also has a café and gelateria on the Rome side. It is a nice way of getting to and from Trastevere. Be sure to get photos from Ponte Garibaldi as Isola Tiberina truly is beautiful. The island is 270 m long and up to 67 m broad. According to the legend envoys were sent to the temple of Asklepius in Epidauros in Greece in 291BC in order to get relief from an epidemic in Rome. The envoys brought one of the holy snakes back with them. The snake swam to the Tiber Island thus determining the place where a temple for Asklepius was built. The successor of the Asklepius sanctuary is the ''Church San Bartolomeo'' which was built by the German ''Emperor Otto III'' around the year 1000. The ''Ponte Rotto'' is what is left from the ancient ''Pons Aemilius'', the oldest stone bridge over the Tiber erected around 180 BC. The bridge was partly destroyed during a flood in 1557, re-erected by ''Pope Gregor XIII'' and finally pulled down in 1598. In 62 BC the Senatorial road construction office replaced the wooden footbridge by the ''Ponte Fabricio''."

The term ""ak"" has also the meaning ""generous"", ""aristocratic"" or ""majestic"". Temur'S chronicler ''Sherif Eddin Ali Yezdi'' reported that the world has not seen a similar building before the point of which extends from earth to the height of heaven. The palace was founded in the hours predicted by astrology. Its construction was begun in 1380 after Temur's conquest of Konye Urgench in Khorezm. Artisans from Khorezm were brought here to work on the palace and create its rich decoration. In 1396 the construction works were almost completed. The Spanish ambassador Clavigo reports that the decoration works still continued in 1404. The dimensions of the building can be perceived when looking at the gate towers: the two towers were 50 m high and had an arch with a span of 22 m. The buildings were destroyed in the 16th cent. by order of the ruler of Bukhara, ''Abdullah Khan''. The legend tells that Abdullah Khan was riding to Shahrizabs and saw the palace at a distance. He sent a messenger to the city as he thought that he was already near of it. The messengers nearly died of exhaustion, but the palace was still far away. The khan got angry and ordered the palace to be destroyed. The architecture of the palace is similar to Khoja Ahmed Yasavi Mausoleum in Turkestan/Kazakhstan which was built on the orders of Temur. Archaeological excavations south of Ak Saray have revealed the rich decorated cover of the floor and rich architectural decoration consisting of majolica, marble and combination of terracotta and ornamental mosaic. Only the piles of the portals are left from Ak-Saray. The piles originally were round towers with spiral stairs inside. Today, the towers are 38 m high. Originally, they reached a height of 50 m. The size of the palace is impressive: the main courtyard was about 120 m wide and 240 m long. Calculations from the proportions of the surviving elements let us assume that the length of the main portal was 70 m and that the towers at the corners were more than 80 m high. The 22 m wide span of the arch of the main entrance was the largest in Central Asia. The mosaic and majolica work in the niche of the portal is particularly refined. The delicate foliage ornamentation also contains calligraphic inscriptions of verses from the Quran as well as a few secular inscriptions. In the middle of the decoration an inscription gives the date of the completion 798 (1395/1396) and the name of the craftsman ''Muhammad Yusuf Tebrizi'' from Tabriz/Persia. The legend tells that the architect after Temur had explained his plans started to make foundations blocks from clay mixed with gold. When Temur asked why he did that, the architect answered that he wanted to be sure that Temur was determined to construct a building that required vast expenditures."

Scott Fitzgerald House, Buffalo, Italianate, Allentown","A comprehensive list of all the architecturally and historically significant private homes in Allentown and the Delaware District would make this article far too lengthy to be useful; however, the two-story, front-gabled Italianate cottage at 29 Irving Place in Allentown is especially significant for a number of reasons. First and foremost, this is the house where F. Scott Fitzgerald, famous as the writer of ''The Great Gatsby'' and other magnificent works of Jazz Age literature, lived for five years during his childhood. Fitzgerald moved with his family to Irving Place at the age of seven, in 1903, after having lived briefly in the '''Hotel Lenox''' on North Street and then in Syracuse for a few years. His childhood friends said later that even at this young age, his intellectual curiosity and interest in literature as a student at Nardin Academy were apparent. Though his family was forced to move away after his father lost his job, he remembered his childhood in Buffalo fondly; even today, it does not take much imagination to envision Irving Place as a setting for some of the scenes in his novels. The later history of the house is a testament to Allentown's decline and rebirth after the stock market crash of 1929; by 1970, when its current owners purchased the place and restored it to its former glory, it had degraded into a seedy rooming house rented to scruffy transients. The F. Scott Fitzgerald House is also notable for having one of the few examples remaining in Buffalo of an intact Italianate portico — a style that is ubiquitous in Allentown."

The mail dial is in principle mechanical astrolabe, showing not only the current time, but also the placement of Sun and Moon in Zodiac, phase of the moon, time of sunrise and sunset, length of astronomical night, time in old Bohemian hours, in unequal hours and other data. From gathering crowds, hardly anybody understands all data astronomical dial displays.   :Then there is a slow-moving 12-month calendar with incredibly delicate, small figure paintings by 19th century Czech painter Josef Manes. Every day on the hour, the upper, glockenspiel-style section of the clock performs the same scene: Death waves an hourglass, the 12 apostles shuffle past small windows, and a rooster crows. After the hour strikes, a Turk wags his head.   :Long after the Turks had ceased to be a threat in Central Europe, their use as an allegorical figure in genre paintings and other art continued. The Czechs often sided with the Hungarians in various battles against increasing imperial power as exercised by the ruling Habsburg family over their dominions, and though the Turks never occupied Prague as they did Budapest, both countries' artists used ""the Turk"" (a dark-complected figure, usually wearing a turban) to represent the dangers of the world, and especially threats to Christianity. In the astronomical clock, the Turk is meant to be the stranger.   :There is a legend about the clock that states the original master builder of its interior clockworks was blinded by the King who commissioned it after the work was completed so the mechanic could never build such a wonderful clock for someone else."

The castle is a relic of the Hunyadi dynasty. In the 14th century, the castle was given to John Hunyadi Serb, or Sorb by Sigismund king of Hungary as severance. The castle was restored between 1446 and 1453 by his grandson John Hunyadi. It was built mainly in Gothic style, but has Renaissance architectural elements. It features tall and strong defense towers, an interior yard and a drawbridge. Built over the site of an older fortification and on a rock above the small river Zlasti, the castle is a large and imposing building with tall and diversely colored roofs, towers and myriad windows and balconies adorned with stone carvings. As one of the most important properties of John Hunyadi, the castle was transformed during his reign. It became a sumptuous home, not only a strategically enforced point. With the passing of the years, the masters of the castle had modified its look, adding towers, halls and guest rooms. The gallery and the keep - the last defense tower (called ''Ne boisa'' = Do not be afraid), which remained unchanged from Iancu de Hunedoara's time, and the Capistrano Tower (named after the Franciscan monk from the castle court) are some of the most significant parts of the construction. Other significant parts of the building are the Knights' Hall (a great reception hall), the Club Tower, the White bastion, which served as a food storage room, and the Diet Hall, on whose walls medallions are painted (among them there are the portraits of Matei Basarab, ruler from Wallachia, and Vasile Lupu, ruler of Moldavia). In the wing of the castle called the Mantle, a painting can be seen which portrays the legend of the raven from which the name of the descendants of John Hunyadi, Corvinus came. In the castle yard, near the chapel built also during Vlad The Third's ruling, is a well 30 meters deep. The legend says that this fountain was dug by twelve Turkish prisoners to whom liberty was promised if they reached water. After 15 years they completed the well, but their captors did not keep their promise. It is said that the inscription on a wall of the well means ""you have water, but not soul"". Specialists, however, have translated the inscription as ""he who wrote this inscription is Hasan, who lives as slave of the giaours, in the fortress near the church""."

Originally built for England's King John in 1210, it was twice besieged in the 17th century (''The Siege of Athlone'') before finally being captured by the Williamites. The closing decades of the seventeenth century were among the most turbulent in this country's history. It is not surprising then to realise that the most dramatic events in the history of Athlone occurred during the Williamite and Jacobite Wars.<p>In 1690 the town was besieged by 10,000 Williamite troops under the command of General James Douglas. The Jacobite force present in the town, under the command of the Governor of Athlone, Colonel Richard Grace, resolutely refused to surrender. Following a week long siege the Williamites retreated.<p>Athlone enjoyed a year of relative peace until June of 1691 when the town was again besieged by the Williamites. This time it was the full Williamite Army of almost 25,000 men led by the Dutch General, Godard de Ginkel which laid siege to the town. The Williamites quickly captured the Leinster town but the jacobites broke down the bridge to stem their advance. Under the command of the French genera, the Marquis de St. Ruth, they courageously resisted all attempts to repair it. A brave Sergeant of Dragoons, Custume by name, lost his life in his attempts to dislodge the vigorous repair works and by so doing became a folk hero celebrated in poetry and story. Ginkels guns, in one of the heaviest bombardments in Irish history, fired 12,000 cannonballs into the tiny Connacht town badly damaging Athlone Castle and reducing other buildings to rubble. The Williamites discovered a fording point and in a surprise attack crossed the river and captured the Castle."

Long-distance buses leave from here to destinations throughout Western Thailand (including Nakhon Pathom and Kanchanaburi) and Southern Thailand (including Krabi, Phuket, Surat Thani, Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan, Hat Yai, and others). The new terminal is a fairly pleasant airport-like structure with air-conditioning, electronic departure monitors (in English), a few bank offices, and fast food restaurants. The ground floor houses mostly Thai restaurants outside. The first floor has ticket sales and most restaurants. The third floor is a small shopping mall and is a good place to sprawl on the floor if you have a long layover. Unlike the rip-off operators at Khao San Road, all buses from here are public, well-regulated, cheap, and reasonably safe. Just buy your tickets at the numbered desk with your destination posted on it (almost always in English). :Getting to the terminal is a bit of headache, as public transport is limited. The easiest option is to take a metered taxi, but if you're going there in the evening, especially during workdays, be prepared to fight a serious traffic jam — getting there can take 30 minutes or a full hour from the city centre. A taxi ride from Khao San Road should end up around 120 baht in favourable traffic conditions.

The Behistun Inscription (also Bisitun or Bisutun, Modern Persian: بیستون ; Old Persian: Bagastana, meaning ""the god's place or land"") is a multi-lingual inscription located on Mount Behistun.  The inscription includes three versions of the same text, written in three different cuneiform script languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian. A British army officer, Henry Rawlinson, had the inscription transcribed in two parts, in 1835 and 1843. Rawlinson was able to translate the Old Persian cuneiform text in 1838, and the Elamite and Babylonian texts were translated by Rawlinson and others after 1843. Babylonian was a later form of Akkadian: both are Semitic languages. In effect, then, the inscription is to cuneiform what the Rosetta Stone is to Egyptian hieroglyphs: the document most crucial in the decipherment of a previously lost script.  The inscription is approximately 15 metres high by 25 metres wide, and 100 metres up a limestone cliff from an ancient road connecting the capitals of Babylonia and Media (Babylon and Ecbatana). It is extremely inaccessible as the mountainside was removed to make the inscription more visible after its completion. The Old Persian text contains 414 lines in five columns; the Elamite text includes 593 lines in eight columns and the Babylonian text is in 112 lines. The inscription was illustrated by a life-sized bas-relief of Darius, holding a bow as a sign of kingship, with his left foot on the chest of a figure lying on his back before him. The prostrate figure is reputed to be the pretender Gaumata. Darius is attended to the left by two servants, and ten one-metre figures stand to the right, with hands tied and rope around their necks, representing conquered peoples. Faravahar floats above, giving his blessing to the king. One figure appears to have been added after the others were completed, as was (oddly enough) Darius' beard[citation needed], which is a separate block of stone attached with iron pins and lead."

Speaking of beer, the drink list makes it clear that — more than '''727 Elmwood''', which opened contemporaneously in the former Blue Monk space; more than '''Allen Burger Venture''', '''Moor Pat''', or any of the other craft beer-centric restaurants Shatzel runs — Thin Man is the rightful heir to Blue Monk's storied legacy: the slate of beers Watkins produces in-house is augmented by a range of several dozen other craft beers that strikes a near-perfect balance between local brews, beers hailing from elsewhere in the U.S. and Canada, and hard-to-find European imports of the type Blue Monk used to be famous for. As for the food Thin Man serves, there are a few nods to the Belgian gastropub fare you could get at the old place — ''moûles frites'' are available in both appetizer and main-course portions — but the menu could be more succinctly and accurately described as a carnivore's wet dream. Pork is the star of the show here, figuring into most of the marquee attractions on the menu: the pork belly ''banh mi'' sandwich comes slathered in liver pâté, pickled vegetables and spicy mayo; the sweet-and-savory ""bacon nubs"" appetizer — cubes of the namesake meat drizzled in a brown sugar maple glaze and seasoned with fresh rosemary — has been likened to ""bacon candy"", and the gargantuan, locally sourced T-Meadow Farm Pork Chop is the most expensive item on the menu (unless you want to spring for the whole sucking pig; call a few days ahead in that case). Outside the porcine realm, the crunchy potatoes are a popular appetizer topped with two types of cheese, the Thin Man Burger is reliable pub grub, and the cheese plate is a popular appetizer. Health food this is not. The ambience in the dining room is an odd blend of hipster-friendly industrial chic and chain-restaurant banality; if that's not your bag, try al fresco dining on the second-floor patio decked over the sidewalk. Service is Thin Man's weak point: it can be slow, clueless, and error-prone, and (""full bar"" notwithstanding) if you're looking to order even the most basic cocktail or mixed drink, or any alcoholic beverage other than beer, good luck. Prices are a bit high, too — especially for the appetizers, which, despite what the menu says, are ''not'' served in shareable-size portions."

The marina also boasts such amenities as a snack bar and ice cream shop ('''The Hatch'''), an upscale restaurant ('''Templeton Landing'''), a waterfront boardwalk that provides access to the small Emerald Beach, and an observation tower that boasts excellent views of downtown, the West Side waterfront, Elevator Alley, Lake Erie, the Niagara River, and Canada.

Later, Saint Andrew of Crete, a martyr of the fight against Byzantine Iconoclasm, was killed on 20 November 766 in the Forum Bovis because of his opposition to the iconoclastic policies of Emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775), and buried in this church. Due to his popularity after the final triumph of Orthodoxy, the dedication of the church changed from Saint Andrew the Apostle to him. During the second half of the ninth century, Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) wholly rebuilt the church, which possibly had been damaged during the iconoclastic fights. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople the monastery, known by the Turks as Kızlar Kilisesi (""women's church""), continued to be inhabited for a while. Between 1486 and 1491, Grand Vizier Koca Mustafa Pasha, executed in 1512, converted the church into a mosque. A folkloric tradition related to a chain hung to a cypress tree in the courtyard. The cypress is since long dead but still stands - together with the chain - inside a small round building in the yard of the mosque. The chain was swung between two people who were affirming contradictory statements, and the chain was said to hit the one who was telling the truth"

Built between 1593 and 1596 by the Portuguese to protect the port against the Ottomans, this fort was in military use for over three centuries. It got its name from the Portuguese fleet sailing under the flag of the Order of Christ (''Ordem de Nosso Senhor Jesus Cristo''). The fort is an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011. Fort Jesus holds artifacts from when Mombasa was a transit port for the slave trade. There are torture rooms, cells, and many other displays from the 16th century. During the British period the fort functioned as a prison and today part of the cells are used as a museum. Many exhibits come from the Portuguese frigate Santo António de Tanna that sank in 1697, including African and Indian pottery, Chinese china, different objects used by the crew and two bronze cannons. Another part of the collection is dedicated to archeological finds from the Kenyan coast. Moreover there are Arabic military equipment, musical instruments and a series of cannons from the 18th and 19th centuries.

The concerts were started in 1929 by conductor Arthur Fiedler and were enhanced with fireworks by philanthropist David Mugar during the bicentennial celebrations in 1976. Sometimes sparsely attended in the beginning, it is televised nationally and has become the country's premier 4 July event with hundreds of thousands squeezing along both sides of the Charles each year. This event also holds the world record for the largest crowd to ever attend a classical concert. Seats closest to the stage go to folks who show up before dawn to wait in line but there are speakers and huge TV screens posted all along the river so everybody can see the show. Parts of Storrow Drive in Boston, Memorial Drive in Cambridge, and Massachusetts Avenue on and near the Mass. Ave. bridge are closed due to extremely heavy pedestrian traffic. Note that the roads and public transit are heavily congested after the fireworks display. There are other celebrations during the day, starting with a flag-raising ceremony at City hall at 9AM. This is followed by a parade to the Granary Burial Ground which is led by the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, Boston's militia, which is the 3rd-oldest military unit in the world. Honors are given at the graves of each of the signers of the Declaration of Independence who are interred there, as well as the victims of the Boston Massacre and Peter Faneuil. The parade then moves on to the Old State House where the Declaration is read in its entirety from the main balcony (which overlooks the site of the Massacre) to the crowd, just as it has been every year since 1776."

McCoy Stadium is the home of the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox, a minor league affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. McCoy Stadium was host to the longest game in baseball history, which lasted 33 innings played for 8 hours over the course of two days in 1981. After major renovations in 1999, the ballpark is beautiful with it’s hand-painted murals of past Pawsox turned baseball greats and left field berm. Photo posters with biographies of players, information about the stadium, and the longest game, hung about the concourses and around the clubhouses make for a good reason as to why McCoy Stadium is one of the most visited minor league ballparks in the country. At McCoy, fans enjoy promotional giveaways, such as “bat night” and “bobble-head night” and after choice games, especially on July 2nd, 3rd and 4th, get the opportunity to watch a fireworks display, which, packing the streets outside, draws citizens from all over Pawtucket. The Pawtucket Redsox also host concerts in conjunction with the Pawtucket Arts Festival, in which past acts included The Dropkick Murphys, The Counting Crows and Bob Dylan. The show at McCoy kicks off the festival in July.  As the Triple-A affiliate of Boston, fans can watch Red Sox players rehabbing injuries with the Pawsox and view possible Red Sox athletes of the future.

The double monastic complex was built in 1313-1340 by Queen Sancha of Majorca and her husband King Robert of Naples. The original church was in traditional Provençal-Gothic style, but was decorated in the 1744 century in Baroque style by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro. Santa Chiara was the largest Clarissan church ever built and it was the first Clarissan church built where the nuns in their choir would have been able to view the performance of Mass. The bell tower, separated from the main edifice, was begun in 1328 but was completed only in Renaissance times.

In the middle ages this was the site of Hungary's most important church and had it not been for the Turks blowing it up. Here is the ruins of the main church of the medieval Hungary, Here stand the basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary, it would be to Hungary what Westminster Abbey is to England. The church was begun in 1016 under Hungary's first Christian king, Szent István. At the time, Székesfehérvár was the capital of the kingdom, and this church was the site of numerous coronations. In addition, from 1038 to 1543 fifteen Hungarian kings were put to eternal rest here (starting with Szent István himself and ending with Szapolyai János). As already mentioned, the church was destroyed by the Turks in 1601 and in 1800 the remains were used to build the '''Bishops Palace''' on nearby Városház square. Today all that remains of the once great basilica are stone walls outlining its form. The big draw, however, is to visit the mausoleum containing Szent István's sarchaphogus. This was discovered in 1803 during the building of the Bishop's Palace. The cherubic forms on the outside and royal relics contained within clearly identified this as the tomb of Szent István. The sarchaphogus originally was taken to the National Museum in Budapest, but was brought back to Székesfehérvár in 1936, and since then has remained in the attractive mausoleum at the entrance of the garden. ''Photography is not allowed in the mausoleum''."

The Allen Street Poutine Company is run by a pair of Fort Erie natives who got their start in Montreal — the birthplace of the dish — before coming south of the border to ply their trade. Like any poutinerie worth its salt, Allen Street offers not only the traditional fries/gravy/cheese curd setup but also a host of different specialty toppings including General Tso's (with hot peppers and the titular Chinese chicken preparation), Montreal Smoked Meat (another classic of Canadian cuisine making its Buffalo debut here), and the gargantuan ""Boss Poutine"" smothered with five kinds of meat. The vibe is spot-on — a trendy Allentown take on the greasy-spoon snack bar template familiar to native Canadians — and, now that they've addressed the problem of their gravy, so is the food. Though it's still scratch-made daily from bone broth and a secret blend of herbs, a little tweak in the recipe took the end result from thick, floury, and lacking in flavor to a savory perfection worthy of any poutinerie in the Great White North; add that to delicious hand-cut French fries and locally produced '''Yancey's Fancy''' cheese curds and you've got a take on a Canadian blue-collar classic that's upscale without crossing the line into pretentiousness. Allen Street Poutine's winning streak continues with their topnotch service — these folks really live up to the stereotype of Canadians as unfailingly friendly, polite, and self-effacing — and the interior, which is a fabulous reimagining of the space that once housed '''Crust Pizza''', eschewing the bright, warm colors for trendy dark hues and dim lighting, with a majestic picture window looking onto Allen Street and a huge, snazzy interior neon sign above the counter."

With jazz music all the rage among the black community at the time, the union's second-floor performance space became the place to see informal jam sessions by members of local ragtime and jazz bands after their workday was finished, or on Sundays, to see them rehearse in the practice space the union provided free to its members. Soon enough, it was a venue in its own right, playing host to world-famous luminaries like Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Holiday, Lionel Hampton, and more. The tradition continues today: the Colored Musicians' Club hosts big-band concerts on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday nights, as well as Sunday afternoons followed by a legendary open jam session in the evening. And if you're interested in the club's storied history, there's also an attached museum ''(q.v.)'' where you can learn all you've ever wanted to know about Buffalo's jazz scene of yesterday and today."

Located, appropriately enough, at the heart of South Buffalo's Irish Heritage District, the shop was founded in 1978 by Tom Heneghan, a first-generation immigrant from Ireland who named it after the famous Hill of Tara. It's proven so popular — both with visitors and with departed South Buffalo natives who come back regularly to check on their old neighborhood — that it's doubled in size since then. You can come to Tara Gift Shoppe to pick up green-white-and-orange ""South Buffalo Forever"" t-shirts or green Bills or Sabres baseball hats, but this place is at its best as a purveyor of authentic, unique Irish imports of consistently high quality (prices can be high, but you get what you pay for). Jewelry, courtesy of Irish manufacturers such as Solvar, O'Connor, and Shanore, comes in Celtic motifs, including some nice claddagh rings; stained glass, wind chimes, and decorative baubles feature Celtic tribal symbols and Irish crosses. Fine china and crystalware from Belleck, Royal Tara, and Waterford are also to be had. Needless to say, Tara Gift Shoppe is a great place to browse, or to pick up a gift for Mother's Day, Christmas, or St. Patrick's Day for that Hibernian on your list. If necessary, they'll ship anywhere in the continental United States."

The ruins are located just outside of the small town of El Tambo in the Cañar Province. The town was named after the Inca palace and temple site. These are the largest known Inca ruins in Ecuador. At the site, you will see the excavated temples of both the Incas and the Cañar. Ingapirca was the northern ruling city of the Inca empire.  '''Directions:''' In order to reach Ingapirca, there are two different access roads from the main Panamerican highway that are approximately 8 to 10&nbsp;km travel: (1) North entrance from El Tambo (recommend option); and (2) South entrance which is just south of Uculoma.  The journey east from the Panamerican takes you through typical southern Andean countryside panorama, including sheep, donkeys, llamas.  You can hire a driver ($20–30 from Cuenca), but there is also a bus service.  Direct buses to the ruins can be boarded at the bus terminal close to Cuenca airport, leaving at 9:00 and 12:20, returning at 13;15 and 15:45, journey time 2¼ hours.  Outside these times, take a bus to El Tambo (2 hours) and change there for a bus to Ingapirca (30 minutes).  The bus fare is $2.50.  The majority of the tours are in Spanish.  There is an English guided tour once per day. Ingapirca is always closed on the many holidays in Ecuador, so make sure to check out the holiday schedule before you take a trip to Ingapirca."

Also, walk up the '''Calle del Conde''', a very old pedestrian shop-lined street that used to be the commercial heart of the city. This street leads to the '''Puerta de la Independencia''', where the Dominican Republic proclaimed its independence from Haiti, and the '''Parque Independencia''', where the country's founding fathers' remains are kept. On Sunday evenings, check out the '''Ruinas de San Francisco''' for live bands playing Merengue, Bachata, Salsa and Son, in a wonderful weekly show where both locals and tourists dance, drink and enjoy themselves. This would be an unforgettable experience! Also check out '''La Atarazana street''' after dark for a variety of romantic outdoor cafes with a spectacular view of the Alcazar and bay area.

The memorial includes the young man's bust and the Foote crest. A second Scheemakers' memorial honors Topham Foote's mother and her second husband Thomas Reeve. Most tourists consider The Last Supper by Francis Cleyn a must-view. The painting and the frame were fully restored in 2003 under the leadership of Churchwarden Michael Harding.

Far less crowded and more relaxed than other beaches in Sihanoukville. Every season more and more beach bars and guesthouses pop up along the beach. Tourists will find accommodation in rooms or bungalows (prices ranging from USD5-30), e.g., Cinderella Beach Bungalows, Castaways Beach Bar and Bungalows. Like most of Sihanoukville's budget accommodation, no air-con is available in Otres Beach lodgings, except for the Secret Garden Resort, at the far end of ""Old Otres"" (Otres 2). Otres Beach is great place for lazy sunbathing, but other activities also available (catamarans, windsurfing, kayaks, various boat trips, bicycles.) Unlike Serendipity Beach, marijuana and marijuana-based baked goods are openly and safely smoked and sold at the beach side bars/guesthouses and on the beach itself, which is now attracting a young Western crowd to the area. A second part of Otres Beach about a 5-10 minute tuk-tuk ride away, referred to as ""Otres 2"", has several guesthouses open and is beginning to attract tourists looking for an even less crowded beach than the relaxed main strip of Otres Beach. Otres 2 is far less developed and less crowded, but offers only minimal activities and locations. There are no stores of any kind in Otres 2, though in the main strip of Otres 1 there's a bank machine. Adjoining that on the road in from Occhuteal is a Khmer village with various stores and a few Khmer restaurants; with a small, modern convenience store on the side road out of the village that leads to and from Occhuteal. Otres has a different climate than Snooky; it may be sunny all day when downtown Sihanoukville and the other beaches are raining and flooding. It's also known in the area as having the best sunset, and people staying in closer beaches often drive out to watch it from there (with few vendors or other harassment unlike closer to the city). Otres is fairly large away from the beach; side roads lead to other areas inland, including along the small river that flows through the broad prairie that lies inland from the beach strip. Along it, another village lies, and a few small resorts, and during high season, a small public market with entertainment. There's a couple of resorts and bars there, including a funky westerner-run backpackery bar and stage, and another more modern one with dining room and also a stage. The river is kayakable, and fish from it is part of the menu among local Khmer. The beach at Otres is very shallow for a couple of hundred metre out, or more, depending on the tide. The bottom is soft sand and clean and when there are no waves very safe for children and novice swimmers."

It is situated in Ravello’s main square and is a ten-minute walk from Villa Combrone. The Villa Rufolo is comprised of a main building that adjoins a chapel with a reception hall and an entrance tower. The tower, known as the Torre Maggiore, is 30 metres high and was once used to spot pirate ships arriving to the Amalfi coast. The estate overlooks the Bay of Salerno and its upper terrace gardens contain cypress trees, cycads, yuccas and palms. The Villa remained with the Rufolo family until they sold it in 1588. Thereafter, the Villa slowly fell into disrepair due to earthquakes, negligence, and property subdivisions. Almost three centuries later it was finally restored by its new owner, a Scottish botanist named Francis Neville Reid.  In 1880, a trip to Villa Rufolo’s garden inspired German composer Robert Wagner to write the second act of his final opera, Parsifal. Every summer since 1952, Villa Rufolo hosts the Ravello Music Festival, an open-air concert held in Wagner’s honor."

Located immediately south of Delaware Park, Forest Lawn was founded in 1849 as a rural-style cemetery on what was then the outskirts of town, and serves today as an arboretum, nature preserve, and celebration of Buffalo's rich history. ""Sundays in the Cemetery"" tours are offered seasonally; conducted variously on foot (sensible shoes are recommended) and on trolleys, each of these themed excursions explores a different aspect of local history through an exploration of the lives of individuals buried at Forest Lawn. Famous people who have been laid to rest here include President Millard Fillmore, Prince Kyril Scherbatow of Imperial Russia, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, aviation pioneer Lawrence Bell, Seneca Indian chief Red Jacket, singer Rick James, and many mayors and other prominent citizens of Buffalo. Deer, birds and other native wildlife are commonly seen strolling these 269 acres (108 ha) of impeccably landscaped greenery, and architecture buffs will love the mausoleums and memorials designed by such Buffalo architecture luminaries as Richard Waite and George Cary, and especially the Blue Sky Mausoleum, completed in 2004 from a design by Frank Lloyd Wright."

Its importance has been internationally recognised and it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  :The old city is a popular tourist attraction, and the site has seen much restoration since the 1960s. It is well maintained, exceptionally clean and well furnished with vendors, though with only a minimum of touts. The heavy restoration is worth noting, since with some ruins and Buddha figures it can lead to a feeling that it is a little over-sanitised, especially in the central zone. The other zones are much less ""restored"" and trips down unmarked tracks can lead to ruins in their untouched state.   :The best way to see the ruins in the Sukhothai National Historic Park is by bicycle. These can be rented from a shop opposite from the main park entrance. It is feasible to walk around the central and northern zones in 6 hours or so. There is also a 40 baht guided tour by electric tram available.  :The best time to see the ruins is mornings when it's a little cooler and before the buses arrive, at noon when they have lunch, or after 16:00.  :The whole site covers an area of approximately 70 square kilometres (~27 square miles) and is divided into multiple zones. The central zone contains the majority of the ruins and a museum. Maps are free at the ticket office.   :*Central zone - It contains 11 ruins in 3 square kilometres, interspersed with moats, lakes and bridges to some island-bound ruins. Mat Mahathat is one of the most spectacular, with a large seated Buddha figure set amid the pillars of a now-ruined sala, and a central chedi flanked by two standing Buddha figures. Wat Sra Sri also has a large chedi and Buddha figure, but is reached by a bridge to the island. There are some nice views from the other side of the lake.  :*West zone - The West zone is a hilly and forested area that contains over a dozen little visited monuments. The area is located West of the walled old town between the road to Tak (Route 12) and the road through the Or gate in the ancient Western city wall.  ::Spread out over an area of several kilometers, it contains mostly small monuments in the forest and on hill tops, most of them a single stupa or other structure.  ::In the days of the Sukhothai empire the area was known as Aranyika. Monks studied the Tripitaka and practised meditation in forest temples. An ancient stone inscription mentions that Ramkhamhaeng, the third King of Sukhothai, visited the area regularly to pay his respects to a Buddha image, believed to be the standing Buddha image of the Wat Saphan Hin.  :*North zone - Wat Phra Phai Luang contains the remains of a number of buildings plus a large prang with stucco reliefs. More impressive is Wat Sri Chum, which contains a massive seated Buddha figure peering through an opening in its enclosure. Look for a stairway on the left as you enter the enclosure; it leads up and behind the Buddha image, though the passage is not always open. Only if you want to have a close look for Wat Phra Phai Luang you need to pay."

Strom, church and hospital were consecrated on October 23rd 1871, in the presence of the Tsarevitch: a church in the rustic style with golden domes facing a complex of wooden pavilions surrounded by shady trees.<p>The icon of its patron saint was brought to the church from the Monastery of St. Panteleimon on Mount Athos and remained there until the church was closed in 1929. St.Pantaleimon, a martyr of the first century AD had been educated as a physician and “treated all those who turned to him without charge, healing them in the name of Jesus Christ.”<p>The hospital’s fees of around 500 roubles per annum limited its use to the nobility, clergy and merchant classes. Initially designed to accommodate 110 patients, by the end of the 19th century their number had increased to 350. A number of buildings from the original hospital complex still surround the church. An enlarged psychiatric hospital on a separate site was built in 1885 and has been rebuilt and extended into the present day.<p>The church was closed in 1929 and was used as a storeroom. It became subject to decay until its restoration after being returned to the Church in 1990. The cross was raised on the restored church in June 2006 and in the following year a monument to Alexander III, destroyed in 1936, was restored to its site in front of the church."

St. Martin de Porres is one of the East Side's first ""blended churches"" — a merger of '''St. Matthew''' in Genesee-Moselle, '''Our Lady of Lourdes''' in Midtown, '''St. Boniface''' in the Fruit Belt, and '''St. Benedict the Moor''' in Cold Spring — and it's unique among them in that the merger came at the request of the parishes, rather than being imposed on them by the Diocese. When the building they call home today was dedicated by Bishop Henry Mansell in 2000, it was the first new Catholic church in 50 years to be built within the city limits. Another way St. Martin de Porres is unique is as Buffalo's only majority-black Catholic church, and among the ways it tailors its ministry to the worship culture it serves is with a rousing gospel choir headed since the parish's inception by the inimitable Ella Robinson, as well as an '''African-American Catholic Gospel Music Resource and Recording Center''' slated for the Parish Center they plan to build on their Humboldt Park campus."

Peter & Paul became dominated in short order by Russians, who began immigrating to Buffalo in the 1880s and were attracted to Lovejoy due to easily available jobs on the railroads. The departure of the Ukrainians for a separate congregation in 1905 cemented SS. Peter & Paul's status as the first Russian Orthodox church on the Niagara Frontier (these days it's affiliated with the '''Orthodox Church in America'''). The congregation continued to grow throughout the 20th Century and into the 21st, accommodating an influx of refugees from the former Soviet Union, and the richly decorated Russian Byzantine-style building in which it meets today, with its unmistakable onion dome, dates to 1933. Visitors to SS. Peter & Paul today will encounter a congregation that is close-knit yet welcoming to newcomers, with uplifting services held in a mix of English and Old Slavonic."

The grandest, the '''Palace of Heavenly Purity''' ('''L''') was designed to house the Emperor's bed chamber, but later became a throne room where the Emperor held court with his ministers. The Palace of Earthly Tranquillity was designed to be the Empress' bed chamber, but later became a Shamanist shrine. The Emperor and Empress' marital suite, where they spent their wedding night, is in this building. To the west of this main complex, the much smaller '''Hall of Mental Cultivation''' ('''N''') was in later years the Emperor's actual bedchamber and office. You can even see where the Empress Dowager Cixi ruled China from behind a curtain for 47 years. The remainder of the Inner Palace is made up of a series of small courtyards, the homes of the Emperor's concubines and household.

Sameba is a synthesis of traditional styles dominating the Georgian church architecture at various stages in history and has some Byzantine undertones. The Sameba Cathedral was erected on the Elia Hill, which rises above the left bank of the Kura River (Mtkvari) in the historic neighborhood of Avlabari in Old Tbilisi on the grounds of what was once a park, and before that the largest Armenian cemetery in Tbilisi, a tiny portion of that cemetery now forms the Armenian Pantheon. Designed in a traditional Georgian style but with an exaggerated vertical emphasis, and regarded as an eyesore by many and venerated by as many others, the Sameba Cathedral has a cruciform plan with a dome over a crossing which rests on eight columns. At the same time, the parameters of the dome are independent from the apses, imparting a more monumental look to the dome and the church in general. The dome is surmounted by a 7.5 m tall cross covered with gold.

This Nationally Registered Historic Place was once the home of Rev. Dr. J. Edward Nash, who — aside from being the pastor of the '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''' from 1892 until his retirement in 1953 — was a personal friend of such nationally-known luminaries of black history as Booker T. Washington and Adam Clayton Powell, and was instrumental in the founding of the local chapter of the NAACP and in advocacy on behalf of Buffalo's African-American citizenry in the years before the Civil Rights Movement. Today, his house is open as a museum that contains engaging exhibits and archival records chronicling the history of Buffalo's African-American community.

The most important work is the one that is located to the right of the aisle. This fresco depicts St. Sylvester in his chair with scenes from his life and shows the year the works were created: 1560. Work was needed in the late 60s to bring the frescoes to light. Painters Lorenzo and Alessandro Torresani are recognized as the creators of most of the paintings.

It has a single dome crowning three tiers of zakomara. In the 1670s, they added two symmetrical annexes, and a refectory leading to a tented belltower. The New (or the Great) Cathedral, also dedicated to the Virgin of the Don, was started in 1684 as a votive church of Tsarevna Sophia Alekseyevna. For the first time in Moscow, the five domes were arranged according to the four corners of the Earth (as was the Ukrainian custom). The Old Believers felt offended by this and called the cathedral ""Antichrist's Altar"". Eight tiers of its ornate baroque iconostasis were carved by Kremlin masters in 1688–1698. The iconostasis' central piece is a copy of the Virgin of the Don, as painted in the mid-16th century. The cathedral frescoes are the first in Moscow to be painted by a foreigner, Antonio Claudio in 1782–1785. Later the monastery reshaped in the red-and-white Muscovite baroque style. Eight square and four circular towers with red-blood crowns were put up in 1686–1711. The Holy Gates of the monastery (1693) are topped with the Tikhvin church (1713–1714), noted for its wrought iron grille. A lofty belfry was erected over the western gates from 1730–1753.

Parts of it existed as early as the tenth century: as it stands now, it is the product of the Gatti Mudhali dynasty of the seventeenth century. Reconstruction and elaboration of the old temple was begun by Mummudi, continued by Siyazhi, and was brought near completion by Vanangamudi.<br />This west facing temple is enclosed by a massive stone wall measuring 306' by 164' reportedly built in the thirteenth century. The main entrance tower ( 5 storeys 90'high) is conceived as a chariot on wheels, drawn by elephants and horses. The huge entrance doors, made of vengai ( pterocarpus marsupium) wood, are studied with untrusting iron knobs each of a different pattern. Their panels are decorated with wooden carvings depicting incarnations of Vishnu.<br />The entrance to the inner sanctum is through a portico supported by six sumptuously carved stone pillars. The scenes of tiger hunting by princes seated on horses and accompanied by footmen are depicted very realistically and with great sensitivity. A pillar of yazhi ( a mythical animal combining features of the lion and the elephant) is so ingeniously carved that a stone ball ( 4 ' diameter) in its mouth can be freely rolled but cannot be rolled out. The wooden doors of the portico are adorned with twenty four panels of excellent carving, some of which have been vandalized. The motifs for these carvings are drawn from the divine exploits of Siva and scenes from the daily lives of ordinary people.<br />The great hall is a fine gallery of sculptures of men, women, and Gods among which the sculpture of the voluptuous rishi pathini ( sages wife) is notable.<br />The ceiling is supported by rows of stone pillars from whose capitals hang elegant chains carved out of solid stone. The ceiling in front of the main shrine is covered by a block of stone seven feet in diameter carved in the shape of an inverted open lotus with parrots. This carving is surrounded by the Gatti Mudhali insignia. The outer walls of the inner most sanctum are covered with inscriptions.<br />Every year on February 21, and the consequent 3 days, a great solar and architectural wonder can be seen in the temple. During sunset, the rays of the sun travel down through the front Gopura at the temple's entrance gate and through a small hole in the and travels across the front plane to fall directly onto the statue of Siva. The movement of the sun beam can be witnessed as it progresses across the front of the temple, making the lingam appear to glow.<br />Several gigantic monolithic pillars of pink granite carved, polished, and ready for erection in the proposed Thousand Pillar Hall lie outside the temple. More are said to be under the ground. Before this project could be completed, Vanangamudi was killed in 1667, leaving the foreground of the temple littered with ruins of a noble dream.<br />A temple tank (about (180' 180') is one of the finest of its kind in South India. Thirty Six Nandhi Sculptures (2' high) of black stone sit at intervals on top of the parapet wall whose inside holds 365 lamp niches. One for every day of the year. Only once in 1873 the pool was cleaned by the Salem Local Fund Board."

It is unusual in that it has never actually been occupied by the Hungarian Royal family, and is more of a pseudo-historical mishmash, like the Mátyás-templom. The first palace, in Gothic style, built and added onto over 300 years, was destroyed by the Christian army that liberated Buda from the Turkish occupation in 1686. In 1715 work started on a completely new, smaller Baroque palace, but over the years more and more space was added to the palace until it reached its current length 304m. The palace, in neo-Baroque style, had many added wings. - Reconstruction after the various indignities suffered during rebellions of the nineteenth century finished in 1904. This reconstruction, by Miklós Ybl and Alajos Hauszmann, was undone by German troops holding out at the end of WWII. The roof fell in entirely and most of the furniture was destroyed. - A Baroque façade which had never existed before and a real dome (there had previously been a faux dome with attic space beneath) were added to the building.

Hazrat Shah Sufi Amanat Khan (R) came from Bihar Sharif, India. At Chittagong he lived in a cottage and accepted service as a ''pankha wala'' (hanging fan puller) in the Judge's Court. From the circumstantial evidence it appears that he was a great man of the late 18th century. The family that lives in the compound of Hazrat Shah Amanat Khan's (R) mausoleum and looks after it are Hazrat Shah Sufi Amanat Khan's descendants. They have got in their possession a Persian ''waqfnama'' (deed of endowment) of ''Anwar Khan'', the son of Hazrat Shah Sufi Amanat Khan (R). Hazrat Shah Sufi Amanat Khan (R) lived a very simple life. His daily routine was to attend to his duties in the Court and to engage in prayers. No one knew that he was spiritually endowed nor did he pose to be such. His spiritual greatness was revealed through a ''Karamat'' (spiritual power with magical elements received from The Almighty Allah) which brought him to the limelight and people came to know that he was a ''Wali'' (saint) of the highest rank. When his spiritual attainments became known, he resigned from his job and remained busy with spiritual religious act and meditation. He is ranked among the greatest saints of Chittagong. People visit his mausoleum specially to seek blessings in matters of litigation. Hazrat Shah Sufi Amanat Khan (R) lies buried in a mausoleum to the east of the Laldighi of Chittagong"

The Saint Petersburg building code did not allow structures taller than the Winter Palace, residence of the emperor. The architect found an elegant solution to the limit of 23.5m : the six-storey Art Nouveau building is crowned with a glass tower, which in turn is topped by a glass globe sculpture created by the Estonian artist Amandus Adamson. This tower creates the impression of a substantial elevation, but is subtle enough not to overshadow either the Kazan Cathedral or the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood. - In 1919, the building was given to the Petrograd State Publishing House. It became the city's largest book store, and was subsequently named ""The House of Books"" in 1938. The book store remained functioning during the Siege of Leningrad until November 1942.

A prominent St. Petersburg merchant I. Lazarev, gave one of numerous houses for Theatre. In 1842–1896 an Italian architect L. Vendramini the house was rebuilt. - In 1896 Grand duke Nikolay Nikolaevich, grandson of Nikolay I, had bought the house and afterwards presented it to his favourite - well-known actress of Alexandrinsky Theatre M.

In 1910 year building was passed to treasury, and then was bought by private entrepreneur I. Piltzov, the inner apartments of the building were reconstructed for presenting theatre productions. - Interiors of theatre, cozy and elegant, bear marks of very different architecture styles, that is why they are eclectic in astonishing way. Well-known in whole city three-flights stairs, reception-rooms, lobbies with quaint patterns of modelling, dissemination of painting and bronze are evidence of refinement of rococo style. In decoration of lobby placed over entrance to the theatre could be seen influence of style of Italian Renaissance. One lobby was specially rebuilt as a grotto, which was stylish tendency in the beginning of 20th century. Walls of this hall were faced with raw masonry, in which cracks were hidden electric light bulbs; and in small ponds placed in the corners of grotto water flowed. Sometimes in theatre came people who were not interested in theatre at all, they were just curious – they wanted to see the luxurious stairs and to visit grotto. - In architecture of the hall – one of the most early and few in number Petersburg interiors of public purpose of the 1900's – it’s possible to see the influence of Russian late classicism, «streamlined neoclassicism». Hall differs from vivid theatre foyers by accented monumentality, plane angles of walls and discretion of architectural details; and elements of architecture borrowed from late classicism went well together with forms corresponding with engineer possibilities of that time. -"

For a very long time it was the meeting point of all foreigners coming to Rome. In the 17th cent it was the residence of the Spanish Ambassador to the Holy See. The area around the residence was Spanish territory and foreigners who stayed here without permission were forced to serve in the Spanish army. The '''Fontana della Barcaccia''' (Old Boat Fountain) on Piazza di Spagna was designed and built in 1627-29 by Pietro Bernini, father of the more famous Gian Lorenzo Bernini. The fountain celebrates the fact that before high walls were built along the banks of the Tiber Rome often used to flood. Once the waters were so high that a boat ended up in the square. The decorations on the fountain imitatie the coat of arms of ''Pope Urban VII, Barberini'' who ordered the fountain to be built. A less aesthetic occupant of the square is Italy's first McDonalds, dating back to 1986. Also in the piazza is a column erected in 1856 to commemorate the Immaculate Conception. The column is topped by a statue of the Virgin Mary, and rests on a base with statues of Moses, David, Isaiah and Ezekiel. The Pope visits the Piazza every year on December 8th to celebrate Immaculate Conception."

Designed by Miklós Ybl and József Hild, and built 1851-1905, it is as high as the Parliament building (96m). -- it's '''the highest church''' in Budapest. It was built here because hundreds of people survived the great flood of 1838 on this spot. Walking in the main entrance, after climbing a series of stairs, the viewer is first greeted with a relief of St Stephen, then a mosaic of Christ's resurrection. There are many notable mosaics in this church, especially those within the dome designed by Károly Lotz, best known for his ceiling frescoes in the State Opera and Ethnographic Museum. While designed here, the mosaics were made in Venice. The foremost Hungarian artists of the day designed the artworks within St Stephen's, among them Bertalan Székely, Gyula Benczúr and two men also known for their work in the Opera, Mór Than and Alajos Stróbl. Here Stróbl contributed the central statue of St Stephen on the main altar.

To the rescue came Olmsted's two sons, the successors in his firm; their 1896 redesign curved Fillmore Avenue to discourage through traffic and added the Humboldt Basin, a lovely '''Lily Pond''', and formal gardens. The Olmsted brothers renamed the park Humboldt Park, a name that was changed yet again in 1977 to its current one. Sadly, like most of the other elements of Buffalo's park system, the integrity of the Olmsteds' original design of the park sustained considerable damage over the course of the 20th Century: the Parade House is long-gone, part of its west edge was sacrificed in 1929 for the science museum, and there's a basketball court where the Lily Pond used to be. But the greatest indignity happened in 1960, when Humboldt Parkway was torn asunder to make way for the '''Kensington Expressway''' ''(see infobox at right)''. The '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy''' is hard at work righting those wrongs: the Humboldt Basin has already been renovated and reopened, the restoration of the '''Shelter House''' is ongoing, and plans are afoot to recreate the Lily Pond."

They worshiped for years on Goodell Street in the Fruit Belt before their building fell victim to urban renewal in 1974, and their current home is the former '''St. Clement's Episcopal Church''' in Delavan-Grider. Services at St. Philip's blend the traditionally Episcopalian with twists that speak to the African-American identity of its members — for example, there's both a traditional and a gospel choir — and St. Philip's is also the home church of the local chapter of the '''Union of Black Episcopalians'''. There are two services a week led by the dynamic Rev. Gloria Payne-Carter."

It is very near from the former Roman Dacia capital - Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta Sarmizegetusa. This strange building from the Hateg County was the object of many controversies between scientists, eager to find its origins. Some had considered that the church was first a mausoleum for Roman general Longinus Maximus, killed by the Dacians; others that it was a temple for Mars god; Nicolae Iorga said that the monument dates from 14th century, and art historian Vatasescu in the last quarter of the 13th century. Many investigations were made. But the monument is still its mystery. It is assumed that the old church was modified along the centuries, especially at the end of the 13th. Built from river rocks, bricks with Roman inscriptions, funerary stones, canalizations, etc., taken from Ulpia Traiana, the Densus church has a bizarre aspect, being admired but also looked with astonishment. In the interior some fragments of painting are kept. The paintings from the upper naves and altar are signed by the artist Stefan (signature that can be seen till today) and are revealing the great artistic skills of the master. The features of the painting send us to those of the St. Nicolae Church from Curtea de Arges, built in the 14th century. The resemblance is telling us that a master from Vallachia was present here in Transylvania."

You can also explore the scenic and serene '''Cruickshank Botanic Garden''' which belongs to the university and is used for teaching and research, as well as being open to the public. The nearby '''St. Machar's Cathedral''' on the Chanonry (a continuation of the High Street) with its two spires, was completed in 1530 and is steeped in history and worth a visit (Aberdeen has three cathedrals, all named after saints). As it is part of the Protestant Church of Scotland, it does not actually function as a cathedral but is always called this. To get to Old Aberdeen, bus route No.20 from Broad Street takes you right there - get off at the High Street. Alternatively take No.1 or No.2 from Union Street and get off on King Street at the university campus (by the playing fields)."

First flights on what was then a parade ground were already undertaken in the first decade of the 20th century, before it became a full-on airport in the 1920s with such dignitaries as president Friedrich Ebert among the first passengers. Tempelhof was one of the first airports to feature a major terminal building (at the time the biggest building in the world before being surpassed by the Pentagon), the first to be linked to the urban rail network of its city (the Berlin U-Bahn) and was a major hotspot of the cold war, including a LOT flight intended for (East-)Berlin-Schönefeld being hijacked and abducted there to escape from the East to the West. The iconic terminal building (built during the Nazi era) was the hot spot of the Berlin airlift (""Berliner Luftbrücke"") in 1948-49. In 1951 a monument was added to its entrance square - then renamed ""Airlift Square"" - to commemorate the airlifts over the Berlin Blockade. The airport was featured in movies like Billy Wilder's ''One Two Three''. Tempelhof closed as an airport on October 30, 2008. Nowadays, the airfield is a spacious park with many visitors in summer and fall. The terminal building is still fascinating - the halls and neighbouring buildings, intended to become the gateway to Europe, are still known among the largest built entities worldwide. The terminal building is used as a venue of fashion weeks or fairs. Tempelhof has been subject to a lot of local politics in recent years. First a ballot measure to keep it as an airport failed and a few years later a ballot measure to keep new construction on its outskirts from happening was successful, thus preserving the urban open space at the cost of an exacerbated housing shortage."

A sign in Greek outside the main entrance testifies to this. The church stands on the same grounds as the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria's offices and the Greek Orthodox cemetery. One explanation for the church's unusual circular ground floor plan (as seen in the photograph) may be that it was possibly built on ancient circular Roman ramparts. The remains of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchs can be found in one of the underground levels of the church. The cemetery contains another Greek Orthodox Church, that of the Dormition of the Virgin."

Worked as a military fortress until 1687 when it was occupied by Austrian troops for the second time. The fortress was a time in possession: Hunedorestilor Family, Francis Gesthy, princes of Transylvania (Gabriel Bethlem, Stefan Bethlem, Gh Rakokzi I, A. Barcsay). The walls of the fortress were besieged often of peasant uprisings culminating with the siege in 1784 during the rebellion of Horia, Cloșca and Crișan. At the end of the 13th century,the fortress has lost strategic importance and was left in decay until 1817 when it was restored by Emperor Francisc I. During the Revolution of 1848, the fortress was occupied by Austrian soldiers and was destroyed in an explosion of the guns store. Over the years, the fortress has undergone many repairs and changes. Fortress complex consists of a central building on top of the hill and the three chambers equipped with gates and reinforced with defensive towers. The walls that can be seen now belong 15th-17th century. You can reach the Fortress on foot by climbing the 113 stepts from the city park and then following one of the two alleys which are surrounding the fortress hill. The fortress can be reached also by cable car. The cable car eases access of tourists to the Fortress"

After war broke out in 1914, Thailand had remained neutral for about three years. When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, King Rama VI still waited on the sidelines. Thailand had good relations with Germany, although eventually King Rama VI joined the Allies by declaring war on Germany and sent a militia of 1,284 volunteers to Europe on 20 June 1918. King Rama IV said that joining the Allies ""would be an excellent opportunity for us to gain equality with other nations"". Thailand had lost land to France and the United Kingdom and had to accept the imposition of extraterritorial rights for the citizens of these nations. By joining the war with the Allies, he hoped that they would be more flexible in amending those treaties in future. The expeditionary force returned to Thailand on 21 September 1919 and the ashes of the dead veterans were taken to be enshrined here three days later. The names of 19 soldiers killed in the Western Front have been inscribed."

Forster and Bertrand Russell. Taking tea in The Orchard is a well-established Cambridge tradition. Planted with apple trees, the large garden of The Orchard is perfect for lounging on a deck chair in the sun with a cup of tea and a scone for sustenance. Long queues can be expected on sunny days, but there is always room to be found in the garden. Immortalised by the poet Rupert Brooke in his 1912 poem ''The Old Vicarage, Grantchester'', Grantchester is a favourite amongst both tourists and students travelling upstream from Cambridge by punt to eat a picnic in the meadows or at the tea gardens called The Orchard. The story goes that in 1897 a group of Cambridge students persuaded the owner of Orchard House to serve them tea, and this subsequently became a regular practice. Later lodgers at Orchard House included the poet Rupert Brooke, who later moved next door to the Old Vicarage (built c. 1685). In 1912, while in Berlin, he would write his well-known poem ''The Old Vicarage, Grantchester'', in which Brooke recalled happy days in the idyllic English surroundings of Cambridgeshire.

It was built from 1861-1869 under the direction of architects Eduard van der Nüll and August von Siccardsburg for then-emperor Franz Josef I. The first performance was ''Don Giovanni'', an opera by Austrian native Mozart, on 25 May 1869. The architecture of the opera was barely tolerated by the picky Viennese when it opened. Van der Nüll did not take these criticisms of his work lightly and committed suicide. A few weeks later, von Siccardsburg died of a heart attack. Doubly cursed, the opera building succumbed to bombs less than 100 years later, during WWII. After ten years of Allied control after the end of the war, many cultural institutions reopened to celebrate the birth of the new Austrian state. This time the opera opened with an adopted son of Vienna's work: Beethoven's ''Fidelio''. The lush curtains and overall elegance contribute to the atmosphere (even the nosebleed seats, so steeply pitched and close to the ceiling a nosebleed becomes a distinct possibility). Inexpensive standing room tickets are made available for every performance and sold the day of the performance. The line forms about two hours prior to the performance. Guided tours in a number of languages are offered. The line at the front side door forms about 1/2 hour before the tour."

Buffalo architecture is the running theme of this place, and you get an eclectic smorgasbord of it: while the exterior is textbook French Second Empire, inside you have a pair of common rooms daringly updated in a trendy Midcentury style, as well as three individually styled, fully handicapped-accessible guest suites decorated with the original works of some three dozen Buffalo-area artists and sporting names that pay homage to some of the design honchos of Buffalo's past. The '''Wade Room''' lives up to its namesake, the designer of Buffalo's '''City Hall''', with Art Deco-inspired light fixtures and artwork; the '''Beebe Suite''' is a Victorian dreamscape of two adjoining rooms with an antique brass bed, French armoire and Eastlake-style marbletop table whose name honors the designer of downtown's '''Brisbane Building''' (where subsequent owner T. C. Tanks kept his jewelry shop); and the decor in the top-of-the-line '''Wright Suite''' is inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's work in Japan, with Asian motifs colliding with his unmistakable Prairie style and a delightful original leaded-glass window as a centerpiece. All rooms have one queen bed and full private baths, and come with air conditioning, WiFi Internet, flat-screen cable TVs, a coffeemaker, full breakfast, parking for one vehicle per room, and (on request) an iron and ironing board. Those with allergies should know that there are cats and a dog in the Parks' private living space on the top floor; however, while the dog may put in an appearance in the common room at breakfast, at no time do the owners allow their animals in the guest rooms."

Martin House'''), it was intended to be built for the University of Wisconsin Boat Club in Madison, but was instead built in Buffalo — in 2007, over a century after Wright's design was finalized — and only thanks to the dogged efforts of a local group of Wright aficionados financed largely by Buffalo-born screenwriter Tom Fontana. The only alteration to the original design was the replacement of the stucco on the exterior walls with concrete.

Founded in 1458 as the site of Rao Jodha's new capital &mdash; hence the name, Jodhpur &mdash; the city has grown around it, and in the 500 years that have passed the fort has never been taken by force.  It's easy to see why: it occupies the entire top of a 150 m hill with commanding views all around, with some three kilometers of massive ramparts built around the edges. An English owned company 'Flying Fox' operate a zip tour out of the beautiful Chokelao Gardens within the fort.  The name ""Fort"" belies the size of the complex, which houses the Maharaja's palace, several temples and, tucked away in the back, an extensive garden still farmed to this day.  Highlights within the palace include:  * '''Chamunda Mataji Temple'''.  Tucked away at the far end of the battlements, this temple is devoted to Rao Jodha's favorite goddess and remains a local favorite to this day.  * '''Moti Mahal'''. (Pearl Hall).  Pearl-colored inside and decorated with colored glass windows, this is where the Maharaja held his audiences, with the five alcoves on the far wall allowing his queens to listen in.  * '''Phool Mahal'''. (Flower Hall).  The most extravagant of them all, this was the Maharaja's pleasure chamber, for dancing girls and revelry.  * '''Sheesh Mahal'''. (Mirror Hall).  Just what the name says.  * '''Zenana Deodi'''.  The inner sanctum of the palace once guarded by eunuchs, this is where the Maharaja's wives whiled away their days.  The delicate sandstone screens and carvings are exquisite.

Parenthetically, the Passage premises have long been associated with the entertainment industry and still remains home to the Komissarzhevskaya Theatre.The name came from a vast gallery between Nevsky Avenue and Italianskaya Street which provided the main passage through the mall. The gallery was covered over by an arching glass and steel roof, thus giving it a claim to being one of the world's first shopping malls. The three-storey building opened on May 9, 1848. It was one of the first structures in Russia to employ gas for lighting. Another innovation was an underground floor, where an electric station would be installed in 1900. Although the store specialized in jewellery, expensive clothes and other luxury goods, crowds of common people flocked to see the most fashionable shop of the Russian Empire. Count Essen-Stenbock-Fermor,- the developer,- conceived of the Passage as more than a mere shopping mall, but also as a cultural and social centre for the people of St Petersburg. The edifice contained coffee-houses, confectioneries, panorama installations, an anatomical museum, a wax museum, and even a small zoo. - To draw even more consumers to the store, the Soleille, one of the largest cinemas in the Russian capital, was opened in the complex in 1908. - In 1933, the municipal authorities declared the Passage a ""model department store"", the only one in Leningrad (former St Petersburg) and one of only three such stores in the Soviet Union. The renovated ""palace of Soviet trade"" (as the media touted it) opened in 1934 and offered about 30,000 types of goods, all manufactured in the USSR. The Children's World section became especially popular with the inhabitants of Leningrad. - Now privately owned by employees and shareholders."

An important remaining example of the Gothic Revival architecture, Donothorne's design incorporated French mediaeval stonework, stained glass and 18th century French panelling. The house was sold in 1950 and was briefly used as a children's home and a Catholic seminary. After a devastating fire and years of neglect the castle was sold to Christchurch Borough Council in 1977 and underwent restoration. Highcliffe Castle is open to the general public throughout the year and is used for weddings, private functions, exhibitions and other public events."

Built in 1680, fort served as a watch tower, atop a quarried hill overlooking the Mumbai harbour. - Up to 18th century, Mumbai consisted of several small islands. In 1661, seven of these islands were ceded by the Portuguese to the British as part of the dowry of Charles II of England. The harbour proved eminently apposite, and the British planned to shift base from Surat to Mumbai. The Siddis, who were of African descent and noted for their navies, had allied themselves with the Mughals. The British, under the East India Company and the Mughals were constantly waged war on each other. As allies of the Mughals, the Siddis also declared the British as enemies. - Faced with relentless attacks by the Siddis in 1672, several fortifications were constructed in Mumbai, and in 1780 the Sewri fort was complete. It stood on the island of Parel, on a hill overlooking the eastern seaboard and Indian mainland. It had a garrison of 50 sepoys (Indian soldier) and was managed by a subedar (Pakistan lieutenant). It was also armed with eight to ten cannons. - After the decline of the regional powers, the fort was subsequently used to house prisoners. It was later converted as a Bombay Port Trust godown. - The fort was built primarily for defence, and embellishments are absent. It is bordered by high stone walls, including an inner ring for added protection. It is landlocked on three sides, and sits atop of sheer cliff of about 60 m. The entrance is a stone doorway that leads into a courtyard. To prevent a frontal assault from the main entrance, the inner entrances were placed perpendicular to the main entrances. There is also a pentagonal room along with a long domed corridor, and linear vaulted structures. - Because the area overlooks the Sewree mudflats, that are frequented by migratory birds, particularly the lesser flamingoes."

In turn, the church gave its name to Lafayette Avenue, at whose intersection with Elmwood Avenue its current red sandstone, Richardsonian Romanesque church, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built in 1891. Today, Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church prides itself on being a welcoming and supportive, yet challenging, community, open to people of all incomes, races, sexual orientations, and other factors — a mindset exemplified by the slogan, ""We love you the way you are, but we might not leave you that way."""

This Gostiny Dvor is not only the city's oldest shopping centre, but also one of the first shopping arcades in the world. Sprawling for over one kilometer and embracing the area of 53,000m2, the indoor complex of more than 100 shops took twenty-eight years to construct. Building works commenced in 1757 to an elaborate design by Bartolomeo Rastrelli, but that subsequently was discarded in favour of a less expensive and more functional Neoclassical design submitted by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe (1729–1800). - The next century, Gostiny Dvor was continuously augmented, resulting in ten indoor streets and as many as 178 shops by the 20th century. By that time, the Gostiny Dvor had lost its popularity to the more fashionable Passage and New Passage, situated on the Nevsky Prospekt nearby. During the post-World War II reconstructions, its inner walls were demolished and a huge shopping mall came into being. This massive 18th-century structure got a face-lift recently and entered the 21st century as one of the most fashionable shopping centres in Eastern Europe.

The natives of Cebu were formally Christianized by Miguel Lopez de Legaspi and Father Andres de Urdaneta on 27 April 1565. However, as they found the natives hostile, the village was set on fire. Later on, in a burnt-out house, a soldier named Juan Camus found the statue untouched. This was proclaimed a miracle. The statue, adorned with gold and precious stones, is in a glass case to the left of the altar. The church sees a constant stream of devotees praying at pews in the sanctuary and in front of statues of saints.

The interiors were remodeled by Andrei Voronikhin at the turn of the 19th century. - The main façade of the Stroganov palace faces Nevsky Prospect. Here, Rastrelli rejects the cour d'honneur in the French manner. By this time, Rastrelli has developed his own style based on exploring the impressive façade, which implies the presence of three risolites, the subordination to a single center, rejection of verticalization, and stretching the building horizontally. Rastrelli gives the building a single mass movement toward the center. He skillfully emphasizes this by subordinating the lateral risolites to the central, imposing group of columns of purely decorative, not architectonic, function, deliberately building up tension toward the center of the sculpted front. Rastrelli uses the giant order, the method of visual fusion of the second and third floor windows, typical for the Baroque, and the differentiated arrangement of columns closely adjacent to the wall in order to create a masterful effect and an impressive Baroque façade facing St. Petersburg's main thoroughfare. The facade carries an entrance arch supported by two Corinthian columns. The arch is crowned with a pediment bearing the Stroganov coat of arms. The spaces under the windows on the facade feature a man's profile. There are two practically anecdotal versions regarding this man's identity. According to one version, the man is the first owner of the palace, Baron Stroganov, whom Rastrelli wanted to surprise. However, many historians claim that the famous architect in fact left his own profile on the palace walls."

The Krishna Matha (or Mutt) was established by Madhvacharya in the 13th century. This is a complex of temples and monasteries located near the Madhva Sarovara, or Madhvacharya's pond. Madhva Sarovara has a ""mantapa"" or canopy at its centre, and the pond is often beautifully lit. Bathing at the Sarovara may or may not be possible. Inquire before taking the plunge.  The main temple itself is constructed in the architectural style typical in Kerala and Dakshina Kannada, with multiple layers around the inner sanctum sanctorum, with no massive sikhara over it as is found elsewhere in South India. There are shrines to subordinate deities including Garuda and Hanuman. On special occasions, the temple area is beautifully decorated with flowers and lamps.  The unusual feature of this temple is that the statue faces west, and away from the devotees. The reason for this, apparently, is that a lower-caste devotee named Kanakadasa was denied entry into the temple, so he tried worshiping from a small window outside it. The Lord was so pleased at his devotion that He turned around to face the window. The window is now known as Kanakana kindi, or Kanakadasa's window. Look for a massive Gopura (or tower) that has since been built over this window.  Remember to take the blessings of the temple elephant located outside the temple. To enter the temple, men have to take off their shirts and vests. Offerings can be made and ""prasadam"" can be bought inside. The temple offers free lunch to everyone at three dining halls, or Bhojana Shaalas.  Outside the temple is the ""Ratha beedi"", or ""chariot street"". On major festive occasions such as the ""Paryaya"", the deity is taken in procession in temple chariots. The chariots themselves are usually stationed at Ratha beedi most times. All around the Ratha beedi are the headquarters of the 8 mathas, or Ashtamathas. These mathas are places of worship in their own right. There are other temples located around the area. In addition, Gita Mandira and the Rajangana, where cultural programmes and discourses held, located a short walk away.  The Ratha Beedi is also a shopping street, interesting in its own right."

The massive roman tower with walls up to 1.7 meters thick most likely had a military function. Initially, the church was added to the tower and had a simple rectangular shape. In the 13th and 14th century, the northern wing was added to the church. With financial help of the Affligem abbey, the small choir was transformed in the 16th century into the Gothic choir that remains today. Until the 18th century, the entrance to the church was a small door in the south wall, the side that now faces the Kraainem town hall. Around 1720, the entrance was moved to the current baroque gate in the tower. From 1170 onwards, the church underwent significant changes: the asymmetric layout was abandoned, and a third section was added under the same saddle roof. The current sacristy, pulpit and two confessionals were also added. The interior was enhanced with furniture that was not originally intended for the church: the origin of the organ is still a mystery, and in 1873 two altars were purchased for 100 francs each from a Brussels church. At the end of the 19th century, the church escaped a complete transformation in Neo-Romanian style, and a more humble design of Jules Van Ysendyck was chosen instead, which preserved much of the antique interior. In 1984, pastor Vanzulpele observed a depression in the archway above the choir, which started a sequence of restorations finally completed in 2012. The current interior is based on the interior after the renovations of 1770. The graveyard around the church is no longer in use and only serves to preserve the historic image of the building. Religious ceremonies are still being held on Saturday and Sunday, when the church can be visited."

Given the precarious nature of the English presence in India at the time (not to mention later attacks by the French and the locals), the church has a defensive stance- thick walls, castellated parapets and a well within the grounds - to withstand any bombardment or siege). The church was consecrated on 28 October 1680. The tower was completed in 1701; the steeple added in 1710 and the tower was connected to the main body of the church in 1759. Robert Clive - more famous as Clive of India- married Margaret Maskelyne here in 1753.

The Gabrielis were known for their music for antiphonal choirs of voices and instruments, which was produced by placing two choirs in choir lofts on opposite sides of the church for a stereophonic effect. The music also symbolized the unity of the church and state, whose representatives in those days sat on opposite sides of the pews. This contrast and unity of choirs with different tone colors and dynamics (''piano'' and ''forte'', as in Giovanni Gabrieli's ''Sonata pian'e forte'', the first musical work to be notated with dynamic markings) helped to bring about the stilo moderno (modern style) in the late 16th and early 17th centuries that we now call the Baroque style.  The 18th-century composer Antonio Vivaldi, renowned in his day for his operas as well as his instrumental and sacred music, was another famous Venetian. The Venetian school, which included Vivaldi and other then-famous composers such as Antonio Caldara and Baldassare Galuppi, was one of the great schools of Baroque opera, rivalling the Neapolitan school.

In 1492, Spain expelled its Jewish population as part of the Inquisition, and many fled to Portugal. One hundred years later, their descendants migrated to Amsterdam for its religious freedom. This happened at a time when the Dutch provinces were fighting for independence against Spain. As to avoid being related to the enemy, these Jewish refugees originally from Spain began to refer to themselves as ""Portuguese Jews"". In the early 16th century, the three Jewish communities that existed at the time merged to form the Portuguese Jewish Community of Amsterdam, which still exists today.

Built on Nevsky Prospekt in 1747 for Prince Mikhail Andreevitch Belosselsky. The original building far smaller than it is today, was designed in the French style with a large private garden and a launch onto the canal, stuccoed and painted in imitation of Parisian limestone. The present palace is said to look similar to the nearby Rastrelliesque Stroganov Palace which is further up the Nevsky Prospect, on the corner of Moika canal. After their major renovations in 1847-48, the palace — complete with piano nobile, concert hall, Van Loo paintings, and palace church — acquired a dazzling Rococo appearance. In 1883 Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich bought and gave the palace its present red exterior. -During the First World War, the palace was the base of the Anglo-Russian Hospital. In 1907 it was nationalised and went on to house a regional Soviet until 1991, when it was designated a municipal cultural centre. Now host chamber '''concerts''' for small audiences. It today also hosts a large '''wax work'''."

You can walk through the castle complex for free, or you can pay for either a guided tour of the interiors and the unique Castle Baroque Theater or pay a small entrance fee to walk up to the top of the castle tower. Plan at least two hours for your visit, and buy supplies for a picnic lunch in the castle gardens at the grocery across the ulice from the castle entrance on Latrán. The best approach to the castle is from Latrán. Walk through the red iron gates to the first castle courtyard that houses the Unios Tourist Information center, public washrooms, a souvenir shop, Doxa Galerie, and in the summer months, a tropically inspired mixed drink stand serving up mojitos, caipirinhas, and daquiris. As you approach the castle, you cross the Bear Moat, where the famous Krumlov bears gambol about lazily. Put a few coins in the slot to help keep them fat and happy.<br> The second castle courtyard features the entrance to the castle tower (50Kč). After slogging up the vertiginous staircase, you are treated to a 360-degree view of the town. Here is also a small fountain, and the main ticket office where you can book scheduled tours of the interior to the castle and the one-of-a-kind Baroque Theatre. The restaurant Maselnice, across from the ticket office, is a good place to stop for refreshment. <br> Tours of the castle interior begin in the third castle courtyard, where you will find another souvenir store and the entrance to the Wenceslas Cellars (60Kč), which now houses modern ceramic art pieces. <br> Plaštovy Most, or the “Cloaked Bridge” is covered by a walkway that leads from the Castle to the Baroque Theatre, and affords another sweeping view of the town. Continue to walk uphill and you will find the entrance to the monumental castle gardens. A newly restored fountain, maze of hedgerows, a revolving theatre [http://www.jihoceskedivadlo.cz/otacivehlediste/?m=2&l=en] and a Medieval-style restaurant, Marketa beckon. At the far end of the castle gardens, you’ll find a lush duck pond, situated in a stand of moody, gnarled trees. This is the perfect picnic spot. <br> The castle's Barqoue theatre is the only one in Europe that survives in its original 18th century form with no modern additions. This means that stage sets are still operated by manual labour, and candlelight is still used to illuminate the stage and orchestra pit. Period performances of operas are occasionally performed at the theatre."

It is dedicated to Virgin Mary, Perivlepta (from Greek, Περίβλεπτος) is an attribute given to her meaning ""the Omnisicent and Clairvoyant"". The benefactor was Progon Zgur, son in law of the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II. The church was painted by Michael and Eutychius, two young painters. Their work shows that styles later adopted in the Renaissance were already current in Byzantine art long before Gioto. The frescoes they painted have all the elements of the renaissance art except perspective. Important frescoes: (eastern wall) the ''portraits'' of St. Klement and Konstantin Kavasila (archbishop of Ohrid), detailed portraits with personal features; ''Lamentation of Christ'', painted with many emotions, Virgin Mary is about to faint, a woman next is holding her, women are pulling their hair from pain in disbelief, on the right notice a woman acting reasonably and trying to stop another from pulling her hair, angels above the whole scene are crying, in the left corner notice a group of women doing what normal people do gossiping about what happened; (western wall) ''Prayer in the olive mountain'' as the apostles are sleeping take a look at their dresses and how well the artists worked with color and showed the roundness of the bodies; (northern wall) ''Death of Virgin Mary'' in order to present the holiness of the moment there is a bunch of angels coming from the gates of the sky to take her soul, above her stands Jesus holding her soul, notice her body and how familiar are the artists with the human anatomy. The figures painted by Michael and Eutychius are not presented the traditional Byzantine way, skinny, emotionless and with their thoughts wondering somewhere. They are presented like healthy, chubby young men with red cheeks. Mihailo and Evtihie are the first Byzantine artists to sign their work (on 20 different hidden locations, look on the front columns at the sword and the cloth of two holy warriors). Their work left strong influence on the Byzantine art."

The Samaritans are an ancient offshoot of Judaism who believe that Mount Gerizim, and not the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, is the location of the Holy of the Holies. The Samaritans of Nablus hold both Palestinian and Israeli ID cards and historically have had good relations with both the Palestinians and the Israelis (they are also represented in the Nablus Municipality). The Palestinians of Nablus revere the Samaritans alleged ability to predict the future with palm readings by using the Samaritan holy books. Kiryat Luza offers tours of their community and even has a gift shop. Genetic studies have made the hypothesis that much of Nablus' Palestinian population are originally Samaritan who converted to Islam at the time of the Muslim conquest of the Holy Land."

The church with the belfry is the biggest Spanish colonial church in Cagayan Valley built by the Dominicans who came to evangelize Cagayan Valley. It was constructed from January 17, 1761 to 1767 under the supervision of Fr. Antonio Lobato, O.P.. The cathedral suffered massive destruction in World War II losing its pipe organ, three wooden retablos, pulpit, wooden choir loft and the painted wooden ceiling all of which were from the early 18th century. The old convent adjacent to the cathedral church was also razed to the ground during the war and was demolished to make way for a new one. The complex was rebuilt by Msgr. Bishop Constance Jurgens who is now entombed inside the church. The Cathedral is also said to be one of the beautiful structures that stood in the land and because of that impression, its portrait can also be seen in Vatican City.

The Pan-American Grill shares the same owner as the '''Pearl Street Grill & Brewery''' (see below), which means that aside from the fact that many of the delicious craft beers brewed and served at Pearl Street are also available here, the menu at the Pan-American Grill bears a great deal of similarity to the one at its sister restaurant. To call the cuisine here ""pub grub"" would be to do it an injustice, but nonetheless, the fairly elegant take on classic American cuisine served here splits the difference between upscale quality and prices that are far more reasonable than other Hotel Lafayette dining destinations such as '''Butterwood Sweet & Savory'''. A familiar yet creative range of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and entrees are accompanied by an ample selection of flatbreads and a range of homemade pizzas available in ""Speak Softly"" (12"") and ""Big Stick"" (18"") sizes — another evocation of the Pan-American Exposition era.

The grounds have long been an esteemed commodity in the city, first surrounding an 1819 mansion that became President James Quincy's home following his presidency. Around the time of the Civil War, Congress considered moving the Presidential residence here from the White House, as the White House was just north of the putrid stench of the mosquito and sewage-infested Washington City Canal in Waterfront. The plan didn't pass the House of Representatives. In 1910, the federal government purchased the ground and later converted it into the extravagant Italianate park that you see today. After the 1968 DC riots, the park was a haven for open-air drug markets, which got worse and worse throughout the crack epidemic of the 1980's. Following the murder of a teenager in 1990, the community decided to take back control of the park, and organized regular citizen patrols throughout the day and night. They were very successful, and the park is quite safe today.

Built in 1906, the Administration Building was the most majestic Frank Lloyd Wright building in Buffalo and the prototypical adaptation of his favored Prairie Style to a large office building. Five stories tall and faced in dark red sandstone brick adorned with bas-relief sculptures and with two waterfall-like fountains flanking the entrance, the building consisted of offices arranged around the perimeter, with balconies looking onto a central court. The Administration Building's interior walls were of hard cream-colored brick with accents in Greek magnesite, and it boasted a state-of-the-art ventilation system and lighting and electrical fixtures designed by Wright himself. After the Larkin Company's bankruptcy in 1943, the Administration Building was left abandoned and decaying, and was eventually purchased by a trucking company who demolished it in 1950 to make room for a parking lot. The wall was restored in 2003; adjacent to it is an interpretive plaque with information on Larkin Company history and Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural legacy in Buffalo."

The '''Ritual Dance Stage''' (舞殿) is the spot where Yoritomo forced the hunted Yoshitsune's Lady Shizuka to perform a dance for him. Rather than celebrating Yoritomo, Lady Shizuka's dance expressed her love for Yoshitsune and her sorrow at his plight. This event is commemorated during the Kamakura Festival in April.

Codrii Vlăsiei was the forest that once covered parts of southern Romania, including the territory of today's Bucharest and the surrounding Ilfov County. Snagov Forest is also a natural protected area by the Aria Naturala Protejata Lacul Snagov (ANPLS) with about 10 different hectares and preserves 20 different species. [[Image:Forest.jpg|thumb|250px|Snagov Forest]] The thick forests were used by Romanians as a retreat during the age of migrations because they were not easy to cross on horseback. In fact, the name of the forest means ""the Forests of Wallachia"". Codrii means ""forests"" in the Romanian language, while Vlăsiei is the genitive form of Vlăsia, the Slavic denomination for Wallachia. Most of the forest was intact until the 19th century, when commerce involving cereals and wood began to develop in Wallachia and the forest was razed for the land to be used in agriculture. Of the old forests only a few small areas remain, mostly north of Bucharest, in localities such as Snagov, Pustnicul, Cernica, Romaneşti and Comana. Băneasa Forest, situated in the north of Bucharest, is in danger to be transformed in a park."

It is at the disposal of King Willem-Alexander by the Act of Parliament. It was built in 1651 as the city hall of Amsterdam, in a period known as the Dutch Golden Age. Many school children learn that because of the swampy soil, it was built on no less than 13,569 wooden poles. In 1795, the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Netherlands, and his brother Louis Napoleon became the first King of Holland in 1806. He acquired the city hall in that year and turned it into a royal palace. It was restored to the original owners when Prince William VI returned to the Netherlands in 1812, but when he was crowned as King William I, he decided that Amsterdam should be the official capital and acquired the city hall once again as a royal palace. This is still a delicate subject among the locals, some of who would like to see the palace returned to Amsterdam. It was completely renovated in 2009. It is mainly used for diplomatic receptions and to welcome visiting heads of state, not as a royal residence."

The villa is reached by a narrow pedestrian road and is situated on a cliff known as “cimbronium,” which gives the Villa its name. Before becoming a hotel and a site for weddings, conventions, and other events, the grounds were passed down from one influential family to another since the 11th century. It became apart of a nearby monastery around the 17th century and eventually fell into disrepair. In 1904, a British baron named Ernest William Beckett fell in love with the villa and purchased it with plans to renovate the grounds. With the help from Ravello architect Nicola Mansi and a French botanist, Beckett added the Villa’s garden, small temples, gazebos, and bronze and stone statues.  The Villa has attracted many famous admirers, including E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, and Winston Churchill. Hollywood actress Greta Garbo and conductor Leopold Stokowski had a famous romantic getaway on its grounds in 1938. A stroll through the estate will reveal poetic inscriptions found on plaques and numerous replicas of Roman busts. One attraction is a statue of Mercury, the Roman messenger god, who invites visitors to a few moments of introspection. Another sight to see is the Terrace of Infinity, a serene location that sits high above a sheer cliff facing the ocean."

Over the years the complex's convent, chapels and several churches deteriorated and in some cases, were completely destroyed. After Habsburg emperor Josef II's religious reforms, the convent was shut down in 1782 and converted into lodgings for the poor. St Anežka, (Sv. Anežka česká) who is pictured on the pink 50 Kč banknote, is the patron saint of Bohemia and founder of the convent complex. She was a daughter of the ruling Premyslid family, but no wallflower in terms of her activism, intelligence and energy. St Francis of Assisi, after whom one of the churches in the complex is named, founded his religious order in 1209 without the sort of financial backing earlier orders had enjoyed. As communism was crumbling, the remaining religious leadership, decimated over years by Communism's anti-religious influence, lobbied the Vatican to finally declare Anežka a saint. This happened 12 November 1989, though Anežka's niece Elizabeth had started the process in 1328! Today, the convent is used to house part of the Czech National Gallery's collection."

It's not just local consensus, either: no less an authority than ''The Telegraph'' named this place the ""Best British Shop in the World"" not once but twice (it's also a two-time winner of their ""Best in North America"" prize), and Parker's has supplied its wares to British embassies and consulates across the country, and even to the restaurants owned by the famously hard-to-please Gordon Ramsay. Despite what you may be picturing, Parker's is a small shop tucked into the corner of an anonymous-looking factory complex on South Park Avenue. The stock in trade begins with homemade British meat pies — pork pies come in a number of varieties including classic, Melton Mowbray, and Stilton, but Cornish pasties, steak and kidney pies, and even chicken tikka pies are also available. Parker's success comes thanks to the obsessive emphasis on quality control exhibited by eponymous owners Damian and Vicky Parker, a husband-and-wife team of expats from West Yorkshire — Damian trained under some of the best butchers and piemakers in Britain before founding the business (originally under the simple name of the ""English Pork Pie Company"") in a tiny kitchen in 2007. Also in stock is a wide array of imported groceries: the bakery turns out sausage rolls and a modest range of dessert pastries such as tarts and scones, British-style breakfast sausage and real English bacon are available at the butcher shop, and imported packaged groceries such as Colman's mustard, Walkers potato chips, Cadbury and Jameson's candies, and cans of Irn-Bru direct from Scotland populate the shelves."

Built in 1383 during the Lanna Thai period, legend has it that the temples site was selected by an elephant sent to roam the mountain side, where upon reaching a suitable spot, it trumpeted, circled three times, knelt down and promptly died, which was interpreted as a sign indicating an auspicious site. The temple offers grand views over the city, but no reward is without effort as you must accent the 200-plus steep steps of the Naga-lined stairs. The climb may be a strain in the high altitude's thin air for the less fit, so you may opt to take the cable car for 20 baht. For the [http://chiangmaibest.com/thai-holidays-festivals/visaka-bucha/ Visaka Bucha holiday] around May each year, it is traditional for people to walk from the zoo to the temple and vast numbers make the pilgrimage to the top, which takes around 4–5 hours.  [[Image:WatDoiSuthepBells.JPG|thumb|Bells at Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep]]  : In the vicinity there are several other attractions you may want to consider visiting. The '''Bhuping Royal Palace Gardens''' are 4&nbsp;km further along the road from Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, with a reasonably easy walk along the meter-wide road shoulder. Or you can get a shared songthaew from Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep for 30 baht, but you may have to wait until it fills up. Further along the road is a '''hill tribe village''', and although tourist-oriented, is really worth the trip. There are many shops for local handicrafts, etc. These are the people from the far north of the country, many originally from Myanmar. There are two areas in the village that require entrance fee: 10 baht to enter a flower garden (where women can take pictures using traditional clothes) and a hill tribe opium museum (the museum is in a very poor condition); and 10 baht to enter the hill tribe waterfall (man-made). [[Image:ChiangMaiHilltribeMarket.jpg|thumb|Market in the hill tribe village]]   : '''Getting there''' is a source of much consternation to many travellers. Clearly marked songthaews leave from Pratu Chang Phuak, next to the 7-Eleven. Prices are listed as 50 baht up and 50 baht down, though once on top the price back down suddenly changes to 60 baht. The drivers wait until they have sufficient (up to 8) passengers before they depart, potentially making for a lengthy wait. Most guidebooks advise taking a songthaew from Mani Nopharat Rd, resulting in the drivers milking the tourist cash-cow and raising their price from a reasonable 40 baht to a ludicrous 500 baht.   : Another option is to take a songthaew from your hotel to the northern gate of Chiang Mai University for 20 baht (if you are close to the city walls), where there will be several songthaews waiting on Huai Kaew Rd to get a full load of passengers for a trip up the mountain. They seem to congregate around the Chiang Mai Zoo, so if you just say ""zoo"" to the driver he will know what you're talking about. Prices range from 40 baht for a one-way trip to Wat Prathat to 180 baht for a full round-trip tour, including the temple, Bhuping Palace Gardens, and the hill tribe village, with an hour at each location, but you may have to wait until there are sufficient people who want the same tour or be prepared to pay more. You can also get between many of these by buying point-to-point tickets at the time you want them, or walking some segment. Any songthaew up the mountain road may be a trial for those prone to motion-sickness, so take appropriate precautions. Also, there may be several little annoying additional costs foreigners. To enter the Doi Suthep itself is free for Thais, and 30 baht for foreigners. Tour operators will ask 700 baht for a tour.   : The journey from the city can be made by motorcycle or a bicycle (with appropriate gearing). The final 12&nbsp;km from the zoo onwards is entirely uphill and will take 60-90 minutes if bicycling."

Nonetheless, it gets some 4 million visitors a year, drawn to the waterfront to see unsurpassed views of Manhattan, Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. Don't miss fireworks displays over the water in the Fourth of July! Most tourists see the Statue of Liberty from Manhattan, but if you're coming by car, it's easier to do so from the Park. Make your reservations on-line [http://www.statuereservations.com/] ahead of time. Admission to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island are technically free, but you need to buy a ferry ticket to make it to both sites. The ferry is first-come, first-served, but your advance reservation will guarantee you a particular window of time in which to visit the Statue. Tickets are sold in the historic Central Railroad of New Jersey (CRRNJ) terminal. While you are waiting for the ferry to depart, be sure to admire its early 20th century ironwork and architecture. For immigrants heading west to places like Chicago and Pittsburgh after processing at Ellis Island, this is where their overland rail journeys began. (Note that it's difficult to walk to Liberty State Park; you can either walk down Jersey Avenue and across the foot-bridge into the park, or take the light-rail which stops outside the park and then take the shuttle bus which will take you in.)"

The style is a simple but handsome interpretation of the Gothic Revival, with majestic stained glass windows designed by the George Hoskins company of Rochester. Aside from the weekly religious services held there, South Park United Presbyterian also actively engages with the South Buffalo community by playing host to a wide and growing variety of cultural events and community happenings."

The man behind it all is Keith Raimondi, an Olean native who built his reputation at a series of increasingly trendy culinary hotspots in Philadelphia before returning to his old stomping grounds to pull off his crowning achievement. He certainly had big shoes to fill — Mark Goldman, his predecessor in this space, is a local legend — and true to form, the old BRKB has been extensively reimagined in a style described by ''Step Out Buffalo'' as a ""turn-of-the-century supper club feel"", but which Raimondi and his staff prefer to call ""classic French cottage"": the walls are painted with pastel tones, giving a pleasant airy feel to the dining room that's perfect for the rustic wood of the furnishings and huge bar. Speaking of, it's the bar that has earned the Dapper Goose most of its hype thus far — served is a modest but carefully selected range of creative cocktails with a highlight on locally produced craft spirits from the likes of '''Lockhouse Distillery''' and '''Tommyrotter''', as well as an impressive wine list founded on European (especially French) vintages and a respectable selection of beer and cider too. But regardless of what the reviewers say, Raimondi wholeheartedly rejects any notion that the food cooked up by head chef Peggy Wong is merely an afterthought to the bar. Similar to the drink menu, the food menu is small in size but well-curated, and focused on the very best of what local producers have to offer. This is ""New American cuisine"" at its best, drawing from a diversity of influences including Continental, Asian, and (especially) Latin American flares to craft a range of dishes that are among the most creative and well thought out you'll find anywhere in Buffalo. Small plates abound — favorites include an appetizer of crispy golden-fried cauliflower drizzled in a dill-rich ""Green Goddess"" dressing, as well as a snapper served in a ceviche with coconut broth and hot peppers (deliciously fresh and not as daunting as it sounds for those who can't handle spice) — but easily the most popular item on the menu is the sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken: a huge bone-in thigh, crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside, served on a bed of kimchi fried rice and spicy pickled cucumbers whose sharp taste is the perfect offset. Fresh seasonal produce abounds, as do ample options for vegetarians — and best of all, you won't break the bank on the bill that comes at the end of the meal. Brunch coming soon."

This was due to the ingenuity of architect Juan de Dios Estrada, who designed the building with his memories and observations of the tremor of 1751 fresh in his mind: the building's modest height, bottom-heavy orientation, wide arches, and robust columns were intended to withstand earthquakes. La Merced was abandoned in 1829 when President Francisco Morazán expelled all clergy from what was then called the Federal Republic of Central America; the church wasn't reopened until 1853, by which time the attached monastery had fallen victim to looters who plundered its building materials for use elsewhere. Today, visitors can take in a distinctive yellow facade that has been called the most beautiful example of Spanish Baroque architecture in Antigua, pay the admission fee for the ruins of the monastery whose courtyard boasts what is reputed to be the largest fountain in Central America (the Mercedarian monks once raised fish in it), or — if you happen to be in town during ''semana santa'' (Holy Week, the week before Easter) — check out the processions that wind through the streets of old Antigua on Palm Sunday and Good Friday, beginning and ending at the church."

The Reichstag was intended to resemble a Renaissance palace, and its architect, Paul Wallot, dedicated the building to the German people. The massive inscription in front still reads: ""Dem Deutschen Volke"" - 'For the German people'. The Nazi leader Adolf Hitler exploited the fire which gutted the Reichstag building in 1933 by blaming the Communists for the arson and for attempted revolution. There is good evidence to suggest, however, that his followers were actually responsible and that this was a manufactured crisis. When German reunification became a reality, the new republic was proclaimed here at midnight on 2 October 1990. The Reichstag has undergone considerable restoration and alteration, including the addition of a spectacular glass dome designed by the British architect Norman Foster. The Reichstag building is well-known in the art world thanks to Paris-based Bulgarian artist Christo's mammoth 'Wrapped Reichstag' project in 1995.

The use of electronic items is prohibited. This temple is open only for Hindus and others cannot enter inside. Even the Hindus admitted to the temple have to follow rigorous dress code and customs. Dress code for men is just Kerala Mundu (White Dhothi) with nothing on from the waist-up. It is available for one time hire or for sale from the nearby shops. Women are required to wear an Indian Sari or Kerala Mundu (The idea is that your legs must not be visible separately). This temple belongs to the Travancore Royal Family and is guarded by the Palace Guards of Travancore. Beware of presence of large number of professional touts at the entrance of temple, who attempt to forcibly sell puja plates with flowers, incense, oil lamps to first timers and tourists. Likewise at exit gates, touts try to hard sell pictures, lamps, and shells by claiming it is holy and sacred. Do not be carried away by claims and politely avoid them."

The chlorine gas used as chemical weapon in the early stages of the war in particular turned out to be rarely deadly because it was dispersed in the air, but caused irreversible damage to the lungs of many unprepared soldiers. For the first time in history, large numbers of veterans thus returned home with permanent breathing problems, a disability preventing reintegration in the labor market. At the end of the First World War in 1918, Belgian social security was unprepared to cope with this new phenomenon, and the ''Association sans but lucratif au profit des mutiléls de guerre'' (''Association for the benevolence of war mutilated individuals'') was founded to construct cheap social housing for the victims. Many such social cités were constructed in Kraainem, the Bouvier-Washer Cité was among the first. The architecture is typically regional: red brick facades alternating with brightly painted surfaces, abutments to the corners of walls, anchors and plaits, etc. The neighboring Korenbloemstraat served the same purpose but was added 10 years later between 1930 and 1932. Many buildings have been modified, but the authentic looks were preserved in Korenbloemstraat no. 28. The Cité is still used as a residential area today, as houses were sold or passed on to heirs after the original veteran inhabitants died. About 20 - 25 min walk from High Kraainem, follow Koningin Astidlaan direction Stokkel until the crossing with the Wezembeeklaan, then take left. Alternatively, take bus 352 direction Kraainem Metro and get off at stop ''Koningin Astrid''."

Eleves, or students, begin their training immediately after completion of Austrian primary education (age 15 or 16), and are expected to be both sporty and clever. The school takes its name from a Spanish breed of horse first mentioned in Roman writings. In 1562, Emperor Maximilian II brought some of these Spanish horses to Austria to found a royal stud farm in Kladrub (Bohemia), housing them for a time in the ""Stallburg"" (oldest section of the Imperial Palace). The present school location was built in 1572. In 1580, Maximilian's brother, Archduke Karl, founded the stud farm in Lipizza near Trieste (now Slovenia). Interest in elegant riding had been growing for about fifty years at that point. During Renaissance times, powerful gentlemen who had already conquered the worlds of finance and politics looked to the writings of antiquity for new learning and an educated lifestyle to which they could aspire. Horsemanship which followed the ancient models described by Socrates and others became the fashion. Xenophon (430 – 354 BC) wrote ""Men who understand the art of horsemanship, in truth, look magnificent."" Who wouldn't want that? In the new Winter Riding School (built 1729-35), tournaments, masked balls, and other entertainment was held, but this would soon draw to a close – the royal stud farms at Lipizza were threatened by Napoleon several times and twice the precious stud horses were evacuated to Hungary.

In the year 1938-39 the districts of Rohtak and Hissar of the then Punjab State experienced severe drought resulting in great loss of human life and cattle.

Art historians have not come to agreement on who painted the apse and the two side niches (Madonna of the Rosary, the symbol of the sacraments with seven streams gushing from the cross, paintings that were covered, and partly restored in 1954). The only thing certain is the date of the murals, which is written in the main apse: 1556. Local tradition attributes them to Taddeo Zuccari, who worked on the decoration of the Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola, while others advance the name of Guido da Viterbo, but historian Cesare Verani attributes them to the brothers Bartholomew and Lorenzo Torresani, who were heavily influenced by the school of Raphael. In the apse you can admire the majestic Glory of the Blessed Redeemer surrounded by the symbols of the Passion, which is very reminiscent of that found in rooms in the Vatican painted by Raphael. In the drum below are represented: the Last Supper, with a background of perfectly constructed architectural scenes, the Crucifixion and the Flagellation. These frescoes were restored in 1955. Along the nave are the side altars with lively, expressive paintings by more recent and still anonymous authors: entering from the left are the Annunciation, St. Elizabeth of Hungary, St. Gaetano, St. Francis, St. Rose of Viterbo, the souls in purgatory and the Assumption. Under the main altar the body of St. Justin Martyr was preserved, covered with wax and moved to Rome on September 22, 1791."

Gerasimus left his family wealth and worldly affairs to become a monk. He departed for the region Thebaid in the Egyptian desert, later again returning to his native Lycia. About the middle of 5th century Saint Gerasimus went to Palestine and settled in wilderness near the Jordan River. There he established a monastery and became known for his righteous life of asceticism and prayer. The story of Gerasimus and the lion, when the saint tamed the animal by removing a thorn from its paw and taught it obedience, became widely known in the Christian world. He is reputed to have attended to the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451.The history of the monastery is also linked to another Christian narrative. Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus were said to have found refuge in a cave here during their flight from Herod. An underground chapel was built on the spot where the Holy Family is believed to have spent the night. The crypt floor also contains the bones of monks who were massacred during the Persian conquest of the Holy Land."

Fittingly, the Oscar-winning movie ''Amadeus'' was entirely shot in Prague. It was also the birthplace of Josef Mysliveček, one of Mozart's contemporaries who was hugely popular in his time but largely faded into obscurity today, and also where many later Czech composers of the Romantic period, such as Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana and Leoš Janáček spent most of their careers."

There is little doubt that he died in this general area after fleeing from the Mongols who had taken the dynastic capital Hangzhou. Modern knowledge of the tomb dates back to the latter years of the 19th century when the Zhao (Cantonese Chiu) Clan of Hong Kong (Zhao was the Song Imperial surname) researched the tomb and declared it to be in Chiwan near the great Tin Hau Temple Certainly there are folk tales of the Emperor's demise current in the Chiwan area and very large numbers of people claiming Imperial descent in the district. But the claims remain debatable. The tomb was restored in the early 20th century and subsequently fell into disrepair. It was rediscovered by a military cook during the Cultural Revolution but left alone. The Shenzhen City Government further restored it in the 1980s. It is in the form of a normal Chinese upper class tomb and the focus of much popular devotion.

The grounds have long been an esteemed commodity in the city, first surrounding an 1819 mansion that became President James Quincy's home following his presidency. Around the time of the Civil War, Congress considered moving the Presidential residence here from the White House since the White House was just north of the putrid stench of the mosquito and sewage-infested Washington City Canal in Waterfront. The plan didn't pass the House of Representatives. In 1910, the federal government purchased the ground and later converted it into the extravagant Italianate park that you see today. After the 1968 riots, the park was a haven for open-air drug markets, which got worse and worse throughout the crack epidemic of the 1980's. Following the murder of a teenager in 1990, the community decided to take back control of the park, and organized regular citizen patrols throughout the day and night.

In 2008, however, the building caught a glimmer of new hope with a purchase by new owners hoping to turn the building into a new cultural venue. The idea hasn't quite taken hold yet, but there is reason to feel optimistic about this Chicago Landmark's long-term future.

In a write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'', Buffalo Proper's food is described as ""honest American cuisine that honors the low country of the South"", but the maddeningly eclectic, immensely creative, and ridiculously upscale concoctions on the menu would be nearly unrecognizable to the average Southerner. For instance, they don't serve rabbit here: instead, it's ""tartine of rabbit en terrine"" with whole-grain mustard, arugula, pickled onions, and armagnac-apricot mostarda (whatever that is). Even that Southern favorite, slow-roasted pork, is crusted with candied malt, drizzled with an alegrette flavored with local craft beer, and accompanied by kohlrabi sauerkraut.

Union Square Park (3.5 acres) is known for its impressive equestrian statue of George Washington, erected to Henry Kirke Brown's design in 1856. In April 1861, soon after the fall of Fort Sumter, Union Square was the site of a patriotic rally that is thought to have been the largest public gathering in North America up to that time. A newer addition, added in 1986, is a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the southwest corner of the park. Union Square is also known for its Greenmarket and also its history as a focus for political demonstrations, most recently protests of the 2004 Republican National Convention. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Union Square became a primary public gathering point for mourners and those seeking information about missing loved ones. People created spontaneous memorials in Union Square, and the square was the setting for vigils held to honor the victims of the attacks."

The temple was restored by an architect named Xu Wei Han in 2005 to reflect its past glories. New restoration are done (still pending in nov 2011) which could limit access to some parts of the monastery.  The third floor of the Tsongkapa Temple has a small room with a resident Lama giving blessings to worshippers.  Away from the large Tsongkapa and Sakyamuni Temples are two smaller ones which are worth visiting. If you are facing the main temples, they are just to your left down the hill towards the large white chorten.  The one closet to the chorten is a Bon temple, the religion which predates Buddhism's initial acceptance in Tibet during the 9th Century A.D.. Bon emphasizes the protective forces of nature, especially of mountains, and includes Shamanism and elements of black magic.  The second has some of the best artwork in the Monastery. From the second floor, you can access the roof for a commanding view of the area. There is a Bon temple on this floor as well with some fairly dark demonic images. In the courtyard lies a very old Tibeten Mastiff who has lived there since he was born in 1994!  The chorten itself is worth a walk to and is arguably one of the more important places for local people to worship on the Monastery grounds.  It was built in 1981 in honor of the 10th Panchen Lama's visit to Shangri-la for the opening of the newly restored Monastery which had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.  For local Tibetans the 10th Panchen Lama is considered one of the most important religious figures in Tibetan Buddhism.  You can see his portrait throughout the Monastery.  Take a walk around it clockwise, spin its prayer wheels, and have a fabulous view of Shika Snow Mountain from its west side.  On the way down the long stairs leading to the main entrance/ exit of the Monastery are several smaller temples. They are quite interesting and few tourists visit them, especially the one to the right as you descend the stairs towards the entrance. Look for its beautiful rose garden.  Bus 3 goes direct to the Monastery, filled with pilgrims. For foreign passengers the bus driver will stop at the ticket office and gesture wildly for you to buy a ticket and may not let you continue onwards unless you do. Monks claim the ticket revenue goes to tourist company and not the Monastery."

In 1667, Dutch and English forces fought over the fortifications, then called fort Willoughby, and the surrounding lands. The Peace of Breda later that year put the whole of Suriname in Dutch hands, however, when the Dutch preferred to retain Surinam and its Sugar factories rather than swap them for what later became New York and the fort was renamed Zeelandia. Initially used as a colonial stronghold for the Dutch, it later served as an army barrack and a prison. In 1982, Fort Zeelandia was the scene of the so-called ''December murders'', as fifteen prominent Surinamese men who had criticized the then military dictatorship ruling Suriname were tortured here and then shot dead. The events remain controversial today, as the exact circumstances are still unclear, but the current president of Suriname is the main suspect. In 1995 the restored buildings were opened to the public as a museum. The collection of the Suriname Museum covers the different cultures of Suriname, the colonial period, 20th century art, a library collection and a photo archive. There is a café and a restaurant (Baka Foto) with an outdoor terrace in the courtyard. In front of the entrance are historical officers houses. This beautiful area gives you an impression of how the city once was when trees lined the streets. A statue of Queen Wilhelmina is on the waterfront, looking over the Suriname River."

After moving to Buffalo on the advice of his wife Christina, who spent several years of her youth here, Friere immediately made a splash with Manuel Barreto Furniture, the shop he opened in 2014 on Delaware Avenue on the southern edge of Allentown. The midcentury-inspired furniture available at Manuel Barreto boasts a striking aesthetic that embodies Friere's philosophy of ""furniture as fine art"" — the sleek, functional linearity of the designs has been compared with Le Corbusier, yet also reflects Buffalo's newfound swagger as a 21st-century city on the move. Friere's eye-popping pieces encompass designs for both home and office and are all individually custom-crafted by local artisans to a high standard; Manuel Barreto is also one of the Buffalo area's only authorized dealers of FLOS brand lighting.

The strident red of the poinsettias, bought by many at Christmas and New Year, is echoed by beds of scarlet salvias. Homes and shop owners alike line the city streets with colourful flower boxes. The sheer profusion of colour that the flower festival and carnival brings to Chiang Mai aptly gives the city its name ""Rose of the North"". On all three days of the festival, prize blooms are on display at Nong Buak Had Park near the city centre. Many types of flower, miniature trees and orchida are put on display for the judges to choose the best of the species.

The VIP viewing stand is right next to the bridge in front of the Chiang Mai Governor's home. The parade route goes up Tha Phae Rd to the gate and turns left and follows the moat to Nong Buak Had Park. The parade moves at a slow pace and stops several times so there is plenty of time to take pictures of the colourful floats, pretty girls and hill tribe people in native costume.

It is located within the Kremlin walls, making the Kremlin facility now a symbol of multicultural harmony in multiethnic Tatarstan. Entry to the mosque is free, although visitors must pay 3 Rubles for plastic slip-covers for their shoes in order to keep the floors clean. Visitors who climb the stairs to the third floor observation balcony do not need to remove their shoes. The prayer hall on the ground floor is open only to men going to pray and the second floor balcony is for Muslim women to pray. All women, though, should cover their hair in all parts of the mosque.<br />From the observation balcony, visitors can appreciate the beauty of the mosque, which is built in a modern design not unlike modern Turkish mosques. The dome in the shape of a lotus flower and the many windows give the prayer hall a bright and airy atmosphere. One uniquely local feature in the mosque is the malachite columns on the minbar (the free-standing pulpit). Some of the 99 names of God are inscribed on the inside of the upper dome and on the window glass, and the name Mohammed is written in a blue disk at the front of the prayer hall. Verses from the Koran, including an incantation against envy, are written on tile in the four corners of the hall, and the names on disks suspended lower in the hall are those of the four rightly-guided caliphs and some of the early prophets.<br />An interesting Museum of Islam is located below the ground floor of the mosque. Entrance is free, and a tour in English may be available if the English-speaking docent is on duty. The museum also has a booklet in English that explains the exhibits that can be helpful. Some of the exhibits include displays regarding the status of Tatar language in the Soviet era, some history of the building of the mosque (note the photo of prayers being held outdoors in the 1990s before the mosque was built), and on the lower sublevel is a history of Islam in Tatarstan, which mentions of Empress Elizabeth's attempt to convert Tatars to Christianity and Catherine the Great's edict allowing mosques to be constructed."

At first British Anglicans came over to spread their belief, but in the late 19th century, most of the Protestant missionaries arrived from the United States. In 1861, King Rama IV gave permission for the construction of the Protestant Union Chapel around Charoen Krung Road, which was commonly known as the English Church. As Protestantism grew, a larger church was required, and in 1904, King Rama V gave permission for the construction of the Christ Church on the condition that Protestants of all nationalities or sects could use it as their house of worship. You might not believe it now, but back then this area was a farming area with canals and orchards.

It is an exclave of the Emirate of Dubai, UAE, to the south-east of its main territory. Its capital town, also named Hatta, includes a reconstructed heritage village by the same name. Hatta is about 115 km (71 mi) east of Dubai City. Because of its altitude, Hatta has a milder climate than the city of Dubai, making Hatta a popular vacation place for Dubai residents. The old village of Hatta includes two prominent military towers from the 18th century and the Juma mosque (built in 1780), the oldest building in Hatta, as well as about 30 loam houses. The reconstructed heritage village displays scenes from everyday life in the past. The traditional water supply (falaj system) has also been repaired. Hatta's status as an exclave of Dubai arose in the late 19th century, when the village of Hajarain or Hijrain in Wadi Hatta was given to Sheikh Rashid I Maktoum, Ruler of Dubai, by Turki bin Said, Sultan of Muscat and Oman."

These two have been steadily growing their own collection of antiques and vintage collectibles for north of 30 years, and with Junk & Disorderly their bounty is now available to the buying public. And what a bounty it is — there's a ton of merchandise crammed into this little place, all as kitschy as the name implies. Going beyond the kitsch factor, it's rather difficult to generalize about the constantly changing lineup of merchandise that passes through Junk & Disorderly's doors, but midcentury vintage knickknacks seem to handily outnumber outright antiques (the cutoff date seems to be around World War II) and specialties seem to include lamps, kitchenware, and above all, a treasure trove of decorative Christmas baubles, vintage ornaments, and other holiday-themed items. But the inventory is a diverse hodgepodge — the owners are known to train their eyes on anything unusual or offbeat, and to travel long distances to do so, with merchandise sourced from estate sales, swap meets, and flea markets across the Northeast. Junk & Disorderly's opening hours aren't what you would call extensive, but if you can't make it to Grant Street on a Friday night or Saturday afternoon but happen to be heading eastward after your visit to Buffalo, you might catch the owners at their table at the Ontario Antique Mall in Canandaigua."

It should be rechristened the Lao Natural, Cultural, and Political Science and History Museum, the historical exhibits on the first floor are modest though very interesting in depicting some of the early history. They include one of the original jars from the Plain of Jars and various stone and Bronze Age implements. The second floor provides great insight into the 18th Century Laotian Kingdom and the customs of the day. It would appear that the Laotians did not treat their guests quite as well in those days, often keeping them from leaving the country for several months. The floor builds up to a fervently revolutionary pitch as it documents the heroic struggle of the Lao against the Siamese (Thai), French, and American imperialists. Exhibits include items such as socks worn by politburo members when they escaped from prison and Kaysone Phomvihane's chest expander. The final rooms, on post-revolutionary Laos, are mostly a photo gallery of pressing topics such as the comrades of the 7th Plenary Session of the Laos People's Congress inspecting fertilizer production processes. The final rooms provide an insight into some of the modern advancements, though these are fairly dowdy and uninspiring. Visitors are routed through the shop, and items look like they have been on sale since the revolution in 1975. A guestbook regularly features amusing arguments between young Western visitors on the merits of communism. Most exhibits are labelled in broken English, though some French labelling remains, occasionally to the exclusion of English."

The Los Angeles Philharmonic, a great orchestra, performs its season at Disney Hall, a striking building downtown designed by Gehry and known for its acoustics. Also, don't overlook the absolutely crucial contribution of classical composers to Hollywood films. The sound of classic Hollywood film music was supplied by highly skilled European classical composers such as Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner, Dmitri Tiomkin and Miklós Rózsa — many of them refugees from fascism or communism in Europe — and also by various native-born Americans, quite a few of whom were trained either in Europe or by Europeans. Today, classical music is still of great importance to Hollywood, and though many names could be mentioned, that of John Williams suffices to make the point."

After serving in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) he established a cavalry division which debuted in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). After holding numerous posts of prestige, he was promoted to General in 1916 and finally retired to become a junior high school principal in Matsuyama. A childhood friend of Shiki, Saneyuki shared his friend's love of the written word, and the two studied literature at Tokyo University. However, at the behest of his brother, Saneyuki embarked on a military career. He was sent to America to study naval tactics, and had on-the-job training during the Spanish-American War (1898).

Ever since, it has almost subsequently been the seat of the government of Holland, and later all of the Netherlands. It used to be surrounded by moats on all sides. Since then it has been modified countless times to accommodate the expanding Dutch government. The moats have been filled, but the castle still borders on a pond (the Hofvijver, ''Court Pond''). In its waters the old buildings continue to mirror themselves. Today, the Binnenhof houses the two chambers of the Dutch parliament and the Prime Minister's office in a small round tower opposite the Mauritshuis. Enter through one of the gates on Plein or Buitenhof and you will find yourself in a medieval enclosed courtyard, surrounded by architecture from the 13th up to the 19th century. There may be crowds gathered here on occasion because of public demonstrations, TV airings or receptions for foreign officials. In the centre stands the '''Ridderzaal''' (Knight's Hall), the centrepiece of the castle, today used for ceremonial purposes. Unfortunately, the other splendid rooms of the complex are closed to the general public. It is possible, however, to attend the meetings of the parliament.

Its highest peak is Shanzidou (扇子陡; Shānzidǒu) at 5,596m. The view of the massif from the gardens at the Black Dragon Pool in Lijiang is noted as one of China's finest views. The far side of the mountain forms one side of Tiger Leaping Gorge (虎跳峡; Hǔtiàoxiá). <p>To reach the mountain area, you have to take a private mini van from the Hongtaiyang square in front of the Mao statue. The mini van costs 20¥ and will wait until it is full before it will leave. There is no official city bus, but the mini vans have adopted the #7 name so people can recognise where they are going. Note that some cable cars can be cancelled due to wind, but there is plenty to see without going up the mountain. <p>The mountain area is part of a national park, which has a ticket gate where you will have to buy a 130¥ entry ticket, this ticket does not include any cable cars or other transportation, which is required to actually visit anything.

You can't walk anywhere from here (closest stop is 6km), and must buy a 20¥ ticket for a shuttle bus, that makes a loop and stops at all the important viewpoints. The bus ticket gives you access to this route and you can get on and off as you please, and can also return back to ticket gate in the end. The ticket itself has a tiny map showing the stops the bus goes to, but is in Chinese. <p>To find the shuttle bus in the tourism centre, follow the signs to ""Blue moon valley bus waiting area"". <p>The first stop is the Blue moon valley where you can see the White water river and artificially made waterfalls. It is worth getting off here. You might be asked to purchase tickets for the electrical bus, which they call the ""Little green frog"". It's not worth it. You would miss the 20-minute walk on a wood trail, which is very enjoyable. The walking trail goes parallel to the electric bus route, so if you can't find it, follow the small bus at first. Walking trail is very nice and goes in different directions. It is paved and well marked with signs. <p>It is possible to take a short cable car to Spruce meadow, or get on the shuttle bus and continue to the next stop, where you can see the white water river dammed up and turned into mini reservoirs. From this stop, you can also get back to the park entrance, you can ask somebody if the bus will go back or continue further to the next stop, which is Yak meadow. <p>If you take the cable car up the mountain to high altitudes, renting a coat is not necessary during the late spring and summer season. You would find it a big burden later. Watch out for altitude sickness in the thin air. On your way to Yu Long Snow Mountain, you may stop by at the Dong Ba Valley culture center. They moved some families from other places to this village and let them live their normal lives. Such domestic scenes as the husband in a family counting change while the wife is comforting the baby or two young siblings baking cookies and selling them to visitors are common.

It lands you in the Wien Mitte area, which is not entirely central, and from where you still may have to change to other means of transportation to get to your destination. The departures are infrequent enough that you may still be better off timewise taking the S-Bahn from Wien-Mitte if it departs more immediately.<br>A useful feature of the CAT for Star Alliance and Air Berlin/Niki passengers is the check-in and '''baggage drop-off at Wien Mitte/Landstraße''' station, so that if you have a flight later in the day, you can drop your luggage in the morning and enjoy a carefree day in the city.

The town was beleaguered for months and many died from hunger. According to legend van der Werff was accused by a frantic crowd of secretly hiding food reserves. He denied it vehemently and to prove his sincerity offered to cut off his arm to serve as food. This made people back off, ashamed of their mistrust. The Van der Werff Park is one of the small parks in Leiden's centre and is probably the most interesting one due to its history. There used to be blocks of houses here but during the cold afternoon of January 12, 1807, a disaster occurred. A ship filled with 18 tons of gunpowder blew up, leveling the surrounding blocks of houses on both sides of the canal and killing hundreds in the process. It's claimed the explosion was heard all the way in Groningen (250 kilometers away). Years later, the area was turned into a park on one side and a laboratory was built on the other; the Kamerlingh Onnes laboratory: famed for at one time being the coldest place on earth, where helium was liquefied for the first time, and superconductivity discovered, which earned Kamerlingh Onnes a Nobel Prize."

The Tianyi Pavilion has a flush gable roof, and is six bays wide and deep, with a corridor extending from the front to the back. In front of the pavilion is a pond that stores water for fireproof. Fan Wenguang, Fan Qin's great-grandson, rebuilt the pavilion by laying rockery around the lake, building kiosks and bridges, planting flowers and grass in the fourth year (1665) of the Kangxi reign in the Qing Dynasty. The whole pavilion and the milieu feature the style of private gardens south of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

The church is small and has a pleasant courtyard which contains the sarcophagus of Macedonia's greatest national hero Goce Delčev. There is a small museum about him in the buildings around the courtyard. The Ottoman Turks usually didn’t permit the building of new churches during their occupation, but as the empire weakened in the 18th century they began issuing permits to appease the population. However, there were many rules to be followed: the exterior had to be without decorations and the floor of the church had to be at least one meter below ground so the church wouldn’t dominate the city skyline. St Saviour Church is example of one of these churches. It was built in the early 1800s on the site of a church destroyed in the 1689 fire (upon entering, on the right are remains of the frescoes and the level of the earlier church). While the exterior is rather simple, the church is famous for its interior and wood carving. The iconostasis is the work of Petre Filipovski-Garkata and Marko and Makarie Frčkovski, the best woodworking artists in the 19th century in Macedonia. The beauty of it is that it is a deep wood carving from whole wood boards (the figures are not attached to each other), and it is not covered with golden paint, as it is tradition in Orthodox churches, so the game of light and dark shades is quite dramatic. The iconostasis was made from 1819 to 1824 and is 10 m long and 7 m tall. There are scenes from the Old and New testaments. The figurines are each 7 cm tall. Look for the creation of Adam and Eve on one of the columns next to the doors of the altar and the dance of Salome, where she dances for king Irod so he would give her the head of St John the Baptist. On the far right are self-portraits of the artists, presented as they are working on the iconostasis. The icons are some of the best of the Byzantine revival."

The museum's best-known attraction is the Pergamonsaal. The Pergamon Altar (165 BC), from the eponymous Asia Minor city-state, is three stories high and served as the entrance gate to an entire complex. It is astounding both because of its size and extremely precise detail, especially in a frieze which shows the gods battling giants. The entire room is the same colour as the building's stone, making the details on the frieze section stand out even more. Facing the stairs, on the left hand side of the room there is a small-scale model of the altar which allows the viewer to see where the frieze segments would have been mounted. A 1:300 scale model of Pergamon city is on the right side of the room. The monumental market door of Milet has just been restored."

This local museum has a collection of archeology and paleontology. It preserves some of the rich archeological finds of the territory and it has a large collection of fossils of the Grigna mountains. The museum also presents a small demo-ethnology-anthropological collection. The archeological session will be further developed: a few pieces of the paleontological collection will be highlighted in a more contextualized installation and a floor of the museum will be devoted to the relationship between man and the mountain (the topic at the centre of the Ecomuseo delle Grigne) with the demo-ethnology-anthropological collection and the contemporary art collection. One section is dedicated to material culture with the farmer objects exposition. Added to this is a focus on the Tapestry School of Esino Lario, with a temporary exhibit of two tapestries (''arazzeria'') from the Carcano Foundation of Mandello del Lario during Wikimania 2016. The tapestries are ''View of Mandello'' and ''The Grape Harvest''. It was possibly, Luigi Furiosi, a designer employed by the Carcano family, industrialists in the field of tin and aluminum, who imagined the synthetic and symbolic representation of Mandello in ''View of Mandello'', maybe to celebrate an important anniversary of the Carcano company. At the foothills of the mountains, in the central part of the tapestry, we can spot the hydraulic factory of Sheets of Tin Foil of the Carcano family who started their business in Somana in 1895. The village of Mandello del Lario is recognizable thanks to some distinctive marks: the mountains which surround it as a natural background, the lake, but mainly the churches and typical buildings of the village. Everything seems to be plunged in the blue shades of the sky and this confers the work an enchanted atmosphere. ''The Grape Harvest'' surely is a significant work of art, both in terms of size (220x160cm) and artist, the famous Umberto Lilloni. The tapestry won the golden medal at the 9th Triennale di Milano in 1951. It represents five women and a young boy harvesting grapes. It is as if the artist had stopped time, leaving the characters in the middle of their movement: even if all the characters have a precise task, they are shown together as if they were light figures on the tapestry's surface. The artist describes with particular attention some details (such as the gestures, the grapes, the baskets) while leaving the atmosphere and the space behind the characters undefined, as if in a fairy tale: a wonderful frame from a cartoon."

As the Portuguese were one of the most important trading nations in Siam, this church was built with a land grant from King Rama I in 1786, about four years after Bangkok was established as Siam's capital. As Portugal's influence overseas diminished, the Portuguese community was dispersed and the church fell into disuse. Due to the Indochina Wars of the mid-20th century, many Catholic Vietnamese and Cambodians fled to Bangkok and adopted this church as their main house of worship. Throughout its history, it has been rebuilt twice, with the present church dating from the 1890s.

This is truly the spot to appreciate the might and grandeur of the Imperial Chinese court during the height of its power in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Despite the transformation of Beijing around it, the Forbidden City, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in conjunction with the Mukden Palace in Shenyang, remains mercifully relatively untouched.

Located in the Iven valley near the Selenge River, the monastery is about an hour off the main paved road connecting Erdenet and Darkhan. The isolated site surrounded by miles of sparsely populated steppe make it seem as though you are seeing it as it was before the rise of communism and modernization. The monastery was constructed between 1727 and 1736 on orders of the Manchu Emperor Kang Xi in honor of '''Zanabazar''', the 1st Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, or leader of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, who invented the Mongolian Soyombo script and is one of Mongolia's most famous artists and influential leaders. Zanabazar's body was interred here in 1788. At its peak, the monastery had 3,000 monks and 40 temples laid out with symmetrical unity according to exacting design specifications by the Emperor of China. The communists closed the monastery, killed several of the monks, and destroyed 10 of the temples in 1937. Luckily, 26 of the temples survived and have been partially restored through help from UNESCO and the Indian government. Several new stupas and a large statue of Buddha have been added recently to the neighboring hills. As of 2012, about 60 monks live in the monastery."

The Lower Falls is often described as being more than twice the size of Niagara, although this only refers to its height and not the volume of water flowing over it. A third falls can be found in the canyon between the Upper and Lower falls. Crystal Falls is the outfall of Cascade Creek into the canyon. It can be seen from the South Rim Trail just east of the Uncle Tom's area."
"Buffalo/Allentown and the Delaware District | eat | Giacobbi's Cucina Citta | Carmine, Italian Ristorante''', July 2015, Michael Jacobbi, Carmine, Italian, Clarence, Transit Road, Allentown, a hot minute, Presto''', Giacobbi's Cucina Citta, Italian, Giacobbi, Allentown, Milanese, an ""Italian Nacho, Italian","Local foodies who mourned the loss of '''Carmine's Italian Ristorante''' in July 2015, when it burned to the ground in a two-alarm grease fire, can rejoice once again: owner Michael Jacobbi has made good on his promise to rebuild and come back better than ever. And for city residents who used to crave Carmine's homestyle red-sauce Italian and wood-fired pizzas but rued the thought of making the drive all the way out to Clarence to indulge, the pleasure is doubled: the business reopened not on a Transit Road strip mall but on the buzzing corner in the heart of Allentown that was once home to '''Café 59''' (and, for a hot minute, '''Presto'''). The menu at Giacobbi's Cucina Citta has been revamped, but the offerings will strike a familiar note to those who were familiar with the old place: the overall rule of thumb is casual Italian with a few upscale flairs here and there; Giacobbi's is not a cooler-than-thou hipster hangout by any stretch of the imagination, but also not out of place in the Allentown restaurant scene. Standouts on the menu include magnificent takes on chicken parmigiana and Milanese, creative appetizers such as a short-rib meatball in mushroom sauce and an ""Italian Nacho"" platter (a flat pasta sheet fried crispy and topped with Italian sausage, hot peppers, olives, cheese and spicy marinara sauce), copious pasta dishes (available, like the meat entrees, either in individual portions or ""family style""), main course salads, and — as always — a slate of a half-dozen specialty artisan pizzas (or create your own) that are probably the most popular item on the menu. A decent selection of craft beers, wines and cocktails are available at the bar, and service is topnotch."

In addition to the priceless works from other churches that curator Mary Holland has collected, such as statuary from '''St. Mary of Sorrows''', icons from '''SS. Peter & Paul Russian Orthodox Church''', and various items from '''Temple Beth El''', St. Francis Xavier itself is a magnificent old building full of beautiful and uplifting art which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was a longtime cornerstone of the Black Rock community."

"Buffalo/West Side | eat | Lait Cru Brasserie | Martin Danilowicz, Martin Cooks''', Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile'', Jill Gedra-Forster, Elmwood Avenue, Will Peterson, Connecticut Street, Gedra-Forster's, Lait Cru Brasserie, August 2016, Nickel City, Lait Cru, 600-day, Buffalo-area, German, all-day, days","When local chef extraordinaire Martin Danilowicz closed the doors of his namesake fine dining destination, '''Martin Cooks''', to embark on his next culinary adventure, '''Horsefeathers Market''' was left with a big expanse of space to fill — much bigger than its next tenant, '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile''', was accustomed to. What to do with the excess? Owner Jill Gedra-Forster had done a brisk business selling sandwiches and other light snacks at the old location on Elmwood Avenue, so the natural answer was to expand her operations into a full-fledged restaurant. Thus — with Will Peterson, former head chef of '''The Black Sheep''', the upscale foodie haven a little further down Connecticut Street that's co-owned by Gedra-Forster's sister, on board — was born Lait Cru Brasserie in August 2016. The fine domestic and imported cheeses Nickel City Cheese still sells the next stall over figure prominently into the gourmet breakfast and lunch fare served at Lait Cru (try the cheese plate if you want to go this route: it comes with a changing selection of three cheeses plus crunchy fried fava beans, wine-poached apricots, and — optionally — luxurious, 600-day aged prosciutto), but this place is no one-trick pony: a range of other locally-sourced goodies from Buffalo-area urban farms like '''Groundwork Market Garden''' and artisanal producers like the West Side's own '''BreadHive Cooperative Bakery''' are amply employed in the selection of sandwiches and other fare. Whether it's the ever-popular ""Nic Mac"" sandwich (house-roasted beef with crunchy sweet pickles and a tangy special sauce) that's caught your eye, or the house-cured salmon on German-style ''vollkornbrot'', or perhaps a selection from the all-day breakfast menu (standard egg, cheese, and meat concoctions enhanced with gourmet ingredients and well-thought-out presentations), you can be assured of fresh, well-balanced flavors, with full advantage taken of seasonal produce. Portions are on the small side and prices are on the high side, but — it bears repeating again — the quality of the ingredients justifies that. You can dine at one of the half-dozen or so tables scattered sparsely across the hardwood floor, but most people seem to opt for a seat at the long, low bar that's a holdover from the Martin Cooks days, where you have a great view of the open kitchen. Dinner hours are forthcoming, so it's claimed, as is a liquor license."

The Dome was built between 687-691 by the ninth Omayyad caliph, Abd al-Malik, atop the ruins of the Jewish Second Temple. The Dome is probably the most spectacular building in the Old City, thanks to a recent renovation in which dazzling gold donated by the King of Jordan in 1993 was layered over the bronze. Despite common conceptions, the Dome is not a mosque, but a shrine which protects beneath its high ceiling a large piece of rock sacred to Muslims, Jews and Christians. The rock is variously believed to be the ""Foundation Stone"" from which the world was created, where Abraham was asked to sacrifice his son (Isaac or Ishmael, depending on the tradition), where Mohammad left the Earth on his Night Journey (a small indentation was reportedly left by his foot), and the site of Solomon and Herod's Temples."

A lifelong East Sider, Witkowski came up in the retail industry as a salesman and buyer in the hat department of upscale downtown clothier '''Peller & Mure''' — that's where he first came to an appreciation for fine men's hats, which he later honed as an apprentice to master milliner Henry Goldstein of Lynn, Massachusetts before striking out on his own in 1980. Today, in addition to the countless neighborhood residents he has helped to cap off (as it were) a formal ensemble in just the right way, Witkowski can boast of having outfitted big-budget Broadway shows like ''Guys & Dolls'' and ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'', of his hats being worn on the big screen by stars like James Garner and Leonardo DiCaprio, and of his store being lauded in the pages of the ''New York Times'' and ''Fortune'' magazine. Orders are called in from around the country for fedoras, porkpies, homburgs, and other hats — all crafted on antique millinery tools — but if you're in the market for one yourself, this pleasant, well-lit store is stocked floor-to-ceiling with selections. Prices rank decisively in the high-end, but what you're paying for is quality that's second-to-none: Witkowski's workmanship hearkens back to the old school, using real beaver, chinchilla and muskrat fur with linings and leather sweatbands carefully sewn in place, rather than glued."

The palace was rebuilt by the Fifth Dalai Lama in three years, while the Thirteenth Dalai Lama extended and repaired it into what it is now. It became winter palace in 1755 when the Seventh Dalai Lama made the Norbulinka into a summer residence. With over 1 000 rooms, the Potala contained the living quarters of the Dalai Lamas while they lived, and their sumptuous golden tombs when they died. As the religious and political centre of old Tibet and the winter residence of Dalai Lamas, the palace witnessed the life of the Dalai Lamas and the important political and religious activities in the past centuries.

Intended to both showcase and enhance the beauty of the Niagara River and Lake Erie and emphasize its significance to the history and identity of Buffalo, the park once also boasted extensive formal gardens. At the north end of the park stood '''Fort Porter''', built in the mid-1840s as a customshouse and military installation. Some time later, Olmsted was given the green light to extend the Front beyond the canal to the edge of the river itself; though it never materialized, this extension would have included playgrounds, a beach, and a boardwalk. Sadly, together with the West Side's other Olmsted park, '''Riverside Park''', Front Park was badly damaged by the urban renewal that decimated the West Side in the middle 20th Century: the construction of Interstate 190 over the former canal bed robbed the concourse of its serene lake views, and the construction of the new plaza for the Peace Bridge in 1951 culled seven acres (2.5ha) from the size of the park, resulted in the demolition of Fort Porter, and routed noisy trucks bound for Canada through the park (the latter problem will be solved by the controversial expansion of the Peace Bridge plaza slated for the next few years, after which trucks will access the bridge from a new entrance away from the park)."

'''It is one of the oldest churches in the world''', and has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The first incarnation of the building was erected on the orders of the Roman Emperor Constantine I (the Great) in 330 CE. While the layout largely corresponds to Emperor Justinian's plans from 540 CE (the first building having been destroyed in a 536 riot), the church was first heavily fortified by the Crusaders and then degraded (mostly through neglect) under Mamluk rule. An earthquake in 1834 and a fire in 1869 didn't help. Today, the structure is mostly sound but somewhat dark and gloomy in appearance, only the adjoining '''Franciscan Church of St Catherine''' (dated 1881 and the site of the yearly December 24 midnight mass broadcast around the world) being in excellent shape. The actual alleged site of Jesus' birth, is located in an cave in the church (the original Manger where Jesus was born was a cave, not a shed, as popularly depicted). There is a star marking the exact location of Jesus' birth in the cave. The original Manger with the star marking Jesus' birth site is called the '''Grotto of the Nativity''', and is accessible from inside the church.

The main facade of the building had a powerful portal and its dome was only a little bit smaller than Ak-Saray. The building of Ak-Saray was intended to turn Shahrizabs into the second capital of the empire.

All products are microwavable, dish-washer safe and oven-proof. The factory is located in a village 7 kms outside Kodai.  The Potters Shed was born from a dream. It all started about 20 years ago in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, when a teacher at the Kodaikanal International School happened to see a village potter at work. Enchanted by the beauty of the teenaged potter's hands, as they shaped the clay on his rustic wheel, the germ of an idea sprouted in his mind. The realization that village potters lead a hand-to-mouth existence, always on the verge of dire poverty, and his commitment to help disadvantaged children prompted him to begin turning his dream into a reality. Quite ignorant of the technicalities of training a village potter in the intricacies of glazed stoneware production, he boldly asked master potters in Pondichery, India, if they would take on the young man, Subramaniam, as a trainee. For them it was a bold experiment and an act of extraordinary generosity. Four years later, Subramaniam was ready to move to Kodaikanal, and the Potters Shed Trust came into being. The production unit and sales outlet are both located in the hill station of Kodaikanal, in South India.  The trustees who manage the production and sale of pottery are all committed to keeping the dream alive, and ensuring the success of the experiment. More village potters have been trained since then, and they have lifted themselves out of poverty, into a life of self sustenance and dignity. Since its creation the trust has changed the lives of other rural children by providing financial assistance for their education and health. Each year, the number of children who benefit from the profits generated by the production and sale of pottery, increases.  Today more than 147 children are educated by the Potters Shed. The children are all from economically disadvantaged families. Parents of these children are either employed as unskilled or part-time workers, or unemployed due to illness or disability. The trust provides tuition and an annual medical examination for children ranging in age from 3 to 18 years in ten different local schools. Once a child is admitted into the programme, the Trust funds her/his education through school.  The trust is aided in its efforts by donations from people who want to make a difference in the lives of children. It appreciates this assistance because, with it, the trust is able to increase the number of young people who benefit from the advantages of a formal education.

Horse-mounted Kazakh nomads in the dead of winter armed with ''only'' an eagle, a 30 lbs bird with 8 ft wingspan and deadly, powerful talons, head out into mountains to find foxes, hares, and sometimes even wolves. After successfully spotting the desired target, the hunter removes a hood, waits for the eagle to see the prey, and releases it. A minute later, the hunter will pull the eagle off the victim, and retrieve the pelt, to later be turned into a hat or coat to protect against the bitter cold. Though not always successful, the best hunters can kill over 50 Corsac foxes and numerous hares in a winter. Though other places in Central Asia, Kazakhs or Kyrgyz have trained eagles for hunting, most are not capable of actually catching live prey. The Kazakh eagle hunters in Mongolia are an except thanks to luck of history. Being part of Mongolia instead China or Soviet Union meant the region was less developed and traditional culture was not suppressed.

Frances' father Oscar Folsom, a prominent lawyer, died at a young age in a carriage accident, whereupon his friend and colleague, Grover Cleveland, took on the responsibility of caring for his widow and two daughters. Cleveland's relationship with Frances would blossom into a romance, culminating in their marriage in 1886, the first and still the only presidential wedding to ever take place at the White House. Folsom Cleveland was immensely popular — the public was struck by her beauty, poise and intelligence, and ladies of the day slavishly copied her fashion sense — and she's still the youngest First Lady in U.S. history. Though the house at 168 Edward Street is not open for tours, the city has placed an interpretive plaque in front of it with details on Folsom Cleveland's life, historical importance, and legacy. Architecture buffs will also take note of this fine example of the mid-19th Century red brick Italianates that remain popular on the Lower West Side."

"Buffalo/North Buffalo | eat | The Sterling | July 2015, Kevin Brinkworth, Elmwood Avenue's, North Buffalo, French, Elmwood, Belgian, Northern French, Blue Monk's, Sterling, Burgundy, gras, Wardynski, mac &, The Sterling of today, Brinkworth, nearly century-long, 1901, Ludwig & Company, A&E","The old '''Sterling Place Tavern''' was reborn in July 2015 under new ownership — namely Kevin Brinkworth, also known as one of the duo behind Elmwood Avenue's ever-popular '''Blue Monk''' — and there are more than a few cues taken from the Blue Monk experience at this brand-new North Buffalo destination. For instance, the popular duck fries appetizer — hand-cut French fries cooked in duck fat — was imported lock, stock and barrel from Elmwood, and the several dozen local and regional craft beers available on tap and in bottles mines much the same territory as well. However, by and large the focus on the menu here is not the Belgian and Northern French gastropub fare that's Blue Monk's stock in trade, but rather an eclectic selection of homemade, gourmet sausages. Featured sausage selections at The Sterling change periodically, but typically include such offbeat, exotic ""rare game"" blends as wild boar with cranberry and red wine, smoked bison with Burgundy and thyme, and duck with foie gras and Sauterne wine. Elsewhere on the small but impressive menu is a slate of combo platters of locally-produced, somewhat less hoity-toity (but still delicious) '''Wardynski's''' sausages with various toppings and sides, a selection of mac & cheese mains with a variety of toppings, and familiar yet well-executed pub grub such as wings, sandwiches, and burgers, the latter of which are especially accoladed. Perhaps most impressive of all, though, are the renovations that have been done here: far from the dank dive it used to be, The Sterling of today boasts a fully redone interior decorated with a copious collection of antique ""breweriana"" and mementos from the Brinkworth family's nearly century-long tenure in the local restaurant industry — check out the 1901 Ludwig & Company piano that was originally commissioned for the Pan-American Exhibition, and the circa-1890 back bar that the owner purchased from the hosts of the A&E television series ''American Pickers''."

Sure, a seemingly endless parade of like-minded imitators had opened their doors over the course of the six years they were in business, but none had quite as extensive and impeccably curated a beer list; none had quite the right vibe, the ''je ne sais quoi''. So maybe it's no surprise that locals were skeptical at first when the space reopened under a management team headed by the father of one of the former owner-partners whose acrimonious split had led to the Monk's demise. However, a few months on, the consensus is that the newly and simply renamed 727 Elmwood is about as worthy a successor as could reasonably be expected — it may not quite reach the rarefied heights that earned its predecessor a place among the top 20 beer bars in the world (according to 2012 poll by readers of ratebeer.com), but at its best, every so often folks who'd enjoyed the Monk will catch some of that old familiar vibe at 727. The beer list is still formidable — there are usually about two dozen brews available on tap and in bottles at any given time, trending more heavily toward local and regional microbrews than the swanky imports that were Blue Monk's stock in trade — and there's also a greatly expanded selection of cocktails at the bar. But it's the food menu where 727 has truly reinvented itself: gone, for the most part, are the steamed mussels and other affected gastropub fare of the old Monk, and in their place you'll find a slate of good old-fashioned American bar food, reinvented with an upscale touch and executed masterfully. Highlights include a range of burgers (the gargantuan 727 Burger may be the most popular item on the menu, while the bacon jam burger is a taste you'll find nowhere else in Buffalo, topped with a fried egg), specialty mac & cheese bowls available in whole or half portions (try the Buffalo Chicken Mac for a real taste of the Queen City, garnished with crumbly blue cheese and diced tomatoes), and — most interestingly — a quartet of poutines in the appetizer section that, while they aren't any more authentic than Blue Monk's version (beef ''au jus'' is, sorry, not a substitute for gravy), are a good sight more interesting and creative. Service can be slow, but then again maybe that's a good thing — there's hardly an Elmwood Village experience more pleasant than lingering with a pint in the pleasant beer garden on a nice day."

The original Sanctuary had suffered from earthquakes and pirate attacks. It was rebuilt several times and only abandoned after the Romans introduced Christianity as the official religion. In modern times, one can see remains from all eras, including the Hellenistic and Roman. There is also a small, excellent museum, with a plaster cast of the famous 'Winged Victory of Samothrace' statue, a consolation that the original was looted from the site on 1863 and is now at the Louvre in Paris. Much of the ""Sanctuary of the Great Gods"", at Paleopoli is forfeited, but the location in a wooded gorge is spectacular.

Paying tribute to his roots in the Southern U.S. with the name of the place, owner Richard Hamilton is an Oklahoma native and veteran restaurateur whose inspiration for Deep South Taco was the authentic, downhome Mexican cooking he dabbled in as a sort of antidote to the hoity-toity fine dining of the places he owned over the years. Far from the sleepy cantina you may be picturing, though, a meal at Deep South Taco is a real experience: as you walk up to the place you see a giant rotating ''lucha libre'' mask on the front wall of the building facing Ellicott Street, framed by psychedelic lights and visuals courtesy of an outdoor video projector; indoors you're bathed in garish blue, purple and red LED lights punctuated by the eerie greenish glow of illuminated heating ducts and bar taps. (If that sounds like too much sensory overload for you, there's also the more subdued environment of the heated rooftop patio, open all year, as well as the outdoor street-level patio perfect for warm summer days.) Deep South's menu is small but packs a punch, dominated by a range of different tacos that you order singly — at $4-5 apiece, you can mix and match a combination of several; favorites include the ''taco de pescado'' (with crispy or grilled tilapia and chipotle mayo) and the ''taco de carnitas'' (spicy pulled pork and guajillo serrano salsa). Tacos are served on homemade tortillas that draw mixed reviews: fresh as can be, but fluffier than you may be used to and sometimes prone to falling apart in your hand. Elsewhere on the menu, there's a meal-in-itself nacho platter smothered in melted ''cortija'' cheese for that extra touch of authenticity, bean and cheese tacos and mushroom tostadas for vegetarian visitors, a chips-and-salsa starter that comes with your choice of three of six salsa options, and side orders of Mexican street corn that are as authentic as it gets."

Crown Prince Friedrich William encouraged them to settle here because most of them were skilled workers or otherwise useful to the kingdom. One memorable artwork, in room nine of the museum, pictures Crown Princess Dorothea exclaiming ""But he's a refugee!"" upon being presented a very valuable set of jewels by Pierre Fromery. The generally agreed-upon view of refugees as poor, without resources let alone diamonds, was blown apart by the talented French Protestants forced to leave their country due to religion. One of the most notable effects of having such a large French population was their influence on the infamous Berlin dialect. Berlinerisch words such as Kinkerlitzchen (from French ""quincaillerie"" - kitchen equipment) and Muckefuck (from French ""mocca faux"" - artificial coffee, though ''that'' etymology is not universally accepted) are unique to the area.

One of them was located on the slope of a hill a bit inland from today's Liu'ao Town. However, unlike the well-preserved (or extensively restored) towns such as Chongwu or Pucheng (in Cangnan County, south of Wenzhou), little of the Ming fortifications remain to be seen in Liu'ao. A small section of the fortress wall (which looks more like a retaining wall) with one gate has been restored (or, rather, built anew); people come to admire ancient (300-year-old, supposedly) banyan trees growing nearby, take a look at some brand-new temples, and admire the views of a well-preserved traditional neighborhood below, with its characteristic gabled roofs.<p>Beyond the ""Old Fortress"", such as there is, an extensive system of trails climbs to the top of the hill. There one can see fortifications of a different kind: a system of tunnels, pillboxes, etc constructed by the People's Liberation Army a few decades ago, and decommissioned later. This may have been associated with the confrontation with the Nationalists, who are in control of Taiwan and Kinmen. While much less extensive than what can be seen on Kinmen, the skilled use of the natural rocks of the mountain in combination with concrete is impressive. Although most of the deeper parts of the tunnel system have been blocked by concrete dams, some of the sections closer to the entrances can be explored by visitors.

Much like the '''Masten District Jazz Festival''', concerts take place at '''Martin Luther King, Jr. Park''' on consecutive Sunday evenings: in this case, the first two in August, beginning at 4PM sharp. The first week features nationally-famous acts, while the second week is all about the local jazz scene that's still going strong in Buffalo — and best of all, performances often feature the same old Hammond B3 organ that was once the centerpiece of the Pine Grill. Also, unlike the Masten District festival, food vendors are on hand (though you're welcome to BYO as well)."

Gardner, the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, greenery","Situated on 39 acres (16 ha) in the far northwest corner of the city, Riverside Park features facilities for every outdoor activity imaginable: baseball diamonds, football and soccer fields, basketball and tennis courts, a swimming pool, a playground, and the '''Ruben ""Bud"" Bakewell Ice Rink'''. Riverside Park was the last addition to Buffalo's Olmsted park system — it was not conceived and built until after Frederick Law Olmsted's death, commissioned by the city in 1898 and designed by his two sons. Riverside Park was intended to finally fulfill the elder Olmsted's dream of a true waterfront park for the city and included all the classic Olmsted elements — a meadow, footpaths, wooded thickets, and a carriage concourse — as well as pleasant minnow pools along its northern boundary. It was to have been connected to the rest of the park system by '''Roesch Avenue''', a parkway leading north and west from Delaware Park which was never built. Sadly, Riverside Park is probably the least well-preserved of Buffalo's Olmsted parks today, owing to the construction of Interstate 190 along the canal bed and the removal of many of the historic Olmsted features. However, the scenic overlook still provides a stunning view over the Niagara River (with direct access to the shore provided by the '''Irene K. Gardner Pedestrian Bridge''' over the expressway), and the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy recently unveiled '''River Rock Gardens''' on the former site of the minnow pools, now reinterpreted as a large chain of stone-bedded rain gardens peppered with greenery, traversed by footpaths, and centered on an elegant stone arch bridge."

The church shows a facade with a bell tower, with the center of the beautiful portal surmounted by a single oculus, and rises on some steep stairs carved into the lava stone. The interior has a single nave with covered ceiling trusses.<br>The history of the Church of Our Lady of Stradella begins with the construction of a simple Marian shrine on the side of the road leading out of Fabrica, in order to protect the traveler. In effect, the Madonna of Stradella should be considered a church outside the city walls — that is, built outside the walls of the first centre of Fabrica. Therefore, it is possible that it may have been born as a small chapel that then, later, was transformed into the building that we know today. The plan is octagonal, the facade is simple, and the only decorative element in the interior is the wall painting of the altar, representing the Madonna and Child, a symbol of local 15th-century painting."

Because the Empress at the time was Catherine II of Russia (also known as Catherine the Great), the church was named after St. Catherine of Alexandria. Under the Soviets, the activities of the church were repressed. For 30 years, the building was used only as storage space for the nearby ""Museum of History of Religion and of Atheism"" located in former Our Lady of Kazan Church. Since 1980's the government used the building as offices and apartments. In 1992, city authorities decided to return the building to the Catholic Church. The restoration of the church was completed in 2008. - The building is in the shape of a Latin cross. The transept of the church is crowned by a large cupola.

The Church of the plant was made by Francisco Oroz, construction directed and performed by Francisco Grotto and idealized by Luiz Mesquita. The curious thing occurs in the plant design, cross-shaped. The works began two years after the commission formed. Completed in 1949, the church became pride of the city and reference point.

What if, instead, you could come to the uppermost reaches of the West Side for a real night on the town, with fine dining at a stylish, upscale sit-down restaurant? Flash forward to October 2014, when the Buffalo Supper Club opened its doors on Niagara Street. The owners promised that ""when you walk in here, you won't think you're in Black Rock; you'll think you're somewhere on Delaware or Elmwood"", and despite its unassuming look from the outside, all is as promised — the dining room makes up for in style and snazz what it lakes in size, with a sleek, minimalist decor, all-black furniture (including a comfy ''chaise longue''!), an electric fireplace, a vintage-style jukebox, and a lively bar serving up a mix of big-name domestic and imported beers as well as local craft brews. Best of all, without skimping on quality, the Buffalo Supper Club's food comes at prices that won't break the bank: nothing on the menu costs more than $30. The food here scores few points for creativity; instead, it offers well-executed takes on familiar favorites such as steak, a range of chicken and seafood mains, classic Buffalo-style fish fry, burgers (the ""Supper Club Blues Burger"", featuring one beef and one chicken patty topped with bacon, American and crumbly blue cheese is a particularly interesting option), and on the appetizers menu, chicken wings that come in Buffalo style, barbeque or your choice of specialty sauces."

Owner John Domres is a consummate beer aficionado — he started homebrewing almost as soon as he could legally drink — and by the time he purchased this little brick shed on Myrtle Avenue and set about renovating it for its new purpose, this part of town had already staked its claim as epicenter of Buffalo's spanking-new artisanal brewing and distilling industry, with about a half-dozen like-minded neighbors in the nearby Old First Ward and Larkinville. The core of Buffalo Brewing's repertoire consists of four permanent beers, all produced 100% by hand and named for years significant to Buffalo's history (easily their most popular offering is ""1842"", a toasty Vienna lager made with imported hops whose name commemorates the invention of the grain elevator by Buffalo milling magnate Joseph Dart), along with a slate of seasonal brews named similarly. The hours they keep are brief, but if you're in town on a Friday or Saturday, they'll fill your growler for the unbelievable price of $15."

Lori Ann Piestewa who was the first Native American woman killed in combat in the U.S. Military in 2003.  Due to the recent name change visitors will find references to the peak under both names (for instance, the road leading to the park on the south side of the mountain still has the prior name).  This mountain, whose summit rises to 2,608 ft (817 m), is much more accessible to visitors than is Camelback Mountain. Picnic areas exist both on the south side of the mountain (Phoenix Mountains Park entrance on Squaw Peak Ln.) and the north side (Dreamy Draw Park, entrance via Northern Ave.). Especially during the hot summer months (up to 110-115°F/43°C in the afternoon), use caution and bring lots of water and a hat. There is no shade and parts of the trail can be quite steep and rocky.

"Buffalo/South Buffalo | eat | The Mahony | April 2016, Mahony, Brian Mahony, Williamsville, the California Culinary Academy, South, France, this formerly derelict century-old, Mahony, British, Mahony, America, Mexican-, Asian, the Mahony Burger, Emmentaler, homemade sauerkraut, Mahony","Opened in April 2016 in the newly renovated '''Fairmont Creamery''' building, The Mahony (eponymously named for chef/owner Brian Mahony, a Williamsville native who got his training at the California Culinary Academy and cut his teeth in the South of France before returning to his hometown) is, in the words of ''Buffalo Rising'', ""one of those places you might want to take an out-of-town business associate"". The sleek, modern decor is the perfect showcase for the stylish rebirth of this formerly derelict century-old warehouse building: to the delight of those looking for a break from the hipster crowd that normally frequents places like this, The Mahony's unusual ambience — like a British spiced up with a touch of industrial chic — attracts an older yet still hip clientele. The owner calls The Mahony's menu ""a tribute to ethnic diversity in America"", with French-, Italian-, Mexican-, and Asian-inspired selections to choose from. That's not untrue, but perhaps a better place to start in describing the food served here is a creative take on pub grub: from wings that come seasoned with your choice of house-exclusive hot and barbeque sauces, to stuffed peppers done up Spanish-style with chorizo and ''manchego'' cheese, to the Mahony Burger (an initially off-putting but ultimately tantalizing combination of ingredients: a blend of regular and corned beef topped with Emmentaler cheese, red onion, pickle, homemade sauerkraut, and spicy mustard), these familiar stick-to-your-ribs favorites are classed up and reimagined for the upscale ""new Buffalo"" scene. Full-size mains eschew steaks and chops in favor of a variety of chicken and seafood dishes, as well as burritos that are a bit pricey but worth it; the drink menu features a decent and reasonably-priced selection of local craft brews. Service is friendly and efficient, and while the place is rarely crowded, when it does, it gets ''loud'' in here — so maybe The Mahony is not the place to go for a quiet, intimate romantic evening."

Why is this tree placed on a pedestal and decorated with garlands? Well, the tree has been linked with Thailand's struggle for democracy and the role Thammasat University has played here. The Bodhi Court is the birthplace of the 8 October 1973 student movement that grew into mass demonstrations for democracy and a new constitution. The students protested against the military junta and insisted on the release of 13 people that had been arrested for demanding a national charter. The number of protesters swelled to the hundreds of thousands and were relocated to the university's football field. On 13 October 1973 this large group of people started to move onto the streets. The following day, the government violently suppressed this mass demonstration, a key event in Thai modern history and the reason why the October 14 Memorial was erected near Khao San Road. On 4 October 1976, the Bodhi Court was the stage of an open-air stage performance that mocked the political culture of that time. When these parodies took hold of the newspapers' headlines on 6 October, the military junta violently attacked the student groups for being defamatory to the royal family. In 1991, a military coup d'état followed and a constitution was drafted that basically maintained the status quo. Students again gathered at the Bodhi Court to protest against the junta. After the 1992 general elections, the opposition to the junta gathered at the Bodhi Court, starting demonstrations that would evolve into more than 200,000 participants. The junta again cracked down in an event known as the Black May Massacre, but eventually all protesters were freed and the junta stepped down in favour of democracy. An important tree, indeed."

EXPO has been described variously as a ""food court"" for the adjacent and attached '''Market Arcade''' and as downtown's fancier, less culinarily daring answer to the '''West Side Bazaar''', but perhaps a better comparison would be to an upscale take on a university dining hall — compete with colorful contemporary decor on the walls, ''loud'' piped-in music (mostly upbeat, singalong-able '90s and early '00s alt-rock hits), and an overall surprisingly youthful feel to the place. The dimly lit interior of this cavernous space accentuates stylish decorative accents like the exposed brick of the wall and the track lighting and exposed ductwork on the ceiling, while also calling attention to the brightly lit LED screens and lighting elements that make up an important component of the decor. EXPO is home to five food counters, most of which are satellite locations of brick-and-mortar restaurants elsewhere in Buffalo, and all of which offer quick service to the downtown lunch crowd. There's also '''GBGB''' — Gypsy Bohemian Grove Bar — where a team headed jointly by the folks behind the West Side's '''Gypsy Parlor''' and Allentown's '''Duke's Bohemian Grove''' pour a range of craft brews as well as some of Gypsy Parlor's signature cocktails — and, in the morning, locally brewed '''Public Coffee'''."

The original building at this place was the brainchild of French missionary Father Pascal in 1809, and completed in 1821. Throughout the second part of the 19th century, the area surrounding the church played an important role for French Christian missionaries arriving in Bangkok. It is near the Oriental Hotel and the French Embassy in an area that still captures somewhat of its French history. The current church dates from the 1910s, when the building was completely reconstructed in a Romanesque style. It was heavily damaged by bombing in World War II, but was restored after extensive repairs. Its rectangular structure and red brick exterior makes it stand out from the dull white surroundings. Its interior is spacious with a high ornate ceiling. Pope John Paul II visited the church in 1984, showing the prominence of the church in the Roman Catholic community of Thailand.

King John may have decided on Odiham as a suitable site for a castle on his visit to the town in 1204. Construction began in 1207 and continued until 1214. In 1216, soon after it was finished, the castle suffered a two-week siege at the hands of the French, but it flourished during much of the 13th century, when it was home to the de Montfort family. Simon de Montfort married King John's daughter Eleanor in 1238, just two years after she had been granted the castle by her brother, King Henry III. This union would have made Odiham one of the most powerful households in the land and Simon was to become a leading figure in the baronial stand against Henry, until he eventually paid with his life at the Battle of Evesham in 1265."

Check out the history of the site at the Hammat Tiberias National Park, which features a small museum in what was originally part of a Turkish bathhouse. The main highlight is a synagogue dating from the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, which has a beautiful zodiac mosaic floor. Much has been made of the mosaic's curious mix of Jewish and pagan symbols, but somehow this seems quite apt in Tiberias, a town that, historically, seems to have been able to reconcile the spiritual with the more earthly. The fame of Hammat Tiberias was such that in AD 110 the Emperor Trajan had a coin struck dedicated to the springs - with the image of Hygeia, the goddess of health, shown sitting on a rock, enjoying the water. The springs were also mentioned by Al-Idris, an Arab writer who lived during the Crusades, and were recommended by the Jewish sage Rambam to his patients."

The place was opened by St. Petersburg avant-garde musician and heartthrob Kirill Ivanov and friends in the beginning of 2011, at the end of 2011 Mishka has already achieved the title of'' St. Petersburg's Best Bar'' according to TimeOut magazine. During daytime, Mishka more of a cafe (with free WiFi), where you can relax, read and/or chat and enjoy a selection of sandwiches and fresh salads. In fact, it's one of the few places that serves in line with the Western understanding of ""salad"" - a huge bowl of fresh greens with a choice of other fresh ingredients to add, rather than the traditional Russian understanding of salad which is usually a lot of mayonnaise with other ingredients and often without any greens at all. There are two spaces - the entrance space is the ""club"" side, generally the rowdier side and the place to get boozed up and drunkenly dance the night away, and the second space is more relaxed, more brightly lit, non-smoking, and a comfortable place to grab a bite to eat (even at 4am!) and sit and chat with your friends without shouting over the music from the entrance space.  At night there is usually a DJ playing (even on weeknights!) whatever hipsters are listening to these days (rather than typical Russian clubs that only play worn-out house and 90s pop) and the bar can get very crowded on weekend nights.

Try to reserve the front seat, even by paying a hundred soms more, because the driver will squeeze 3 passengers in the back seat. In 2012 the price was 1000-1500 soms per person.

Shared vans or taxis between Kara-Su and Osh are frequent and cost 30-40 soms. In Bishkek, the minivans arrive at the Dordoi Bazaar.

You don't have to book seats in advance: just come there and choose the car and the driver you like. In reverse direction it's similar.

To call what they offer ""seal-watching excursions"" wouldn't do them justice: much more than just another touristy trifle, these tours are true educational experiences, where seasoned guides put their affiliation with the '''Marine Mammal Watchers' Network''' ''(Réseau d'observateurs des mammifères marins)'' to good use in providing a window into the delicate ecosystem of Gaspé Bay, conducted in a manner that is sustainable and respectful of the natural environment. It's not all dry academia, though — the learning experience is punctuated daily by unforgettable sights like a pod of seals dancing and playing around your boat, the plaintive bellow of whales breeching in the distance, and seabirds by the hundreds taking flight from the top of the sheer seaside cliffs. Cap Aventure offers a range of excursions tailored to customers' individual needs: the short '''Meet the Seals''' ''(Rencontre avec les phoques)'' excursion is open to participants five and older and sticks to the interior of Gaspé Bay, while longer tours round Cap Gaspé into the estuary or even pass southward down the Gaspesian coast as far as Bonaventure Island. The '''Seals at Sunset''' ''(Phoques au coucher du soleil)'' excursion is especially popular. All excursions depart from '''Grande-Grave Wharf''', with the exception of the '''Around Forillon''' ''(Pourtour de Forillon)'' tour, which leaves from Cap-des-Rosiers. The season runs from June 13 through September 13, and wetsuits are provided during the spring and fall. Website in French only."

Michelle's is distinct from most of Buffalo's other Caribbean restaurants in that the food they serve is not Jamaican in provenance but comes from Trinidad and Tobago, a country where classic Caribbean flavors are tempered by a diversity of culinary influences including Hispanic, African, Indian, and even Chinese. Accordingly, head chef Marlene Bernard's menu accommodates everything from well-known favorites like oxtail and escoveitch fish, to Trinidadian particularities such as ""doubles"" (a sandwich of fried flatbread stuffed with curried chickpeas) and ''dhalpuri roti'', to full-blown fusion dishes like ''pelau'' salad (which bears a resemblance to both the South Asian rice dish ''pulao'' and the ''jambalaya'' of Louisiana Creole cuisine) and ""Caribbean Chinese"" chicken, lightly breaded and served over fried rice and mixed vegetables — the folks at Michelle's call it ""morish"" food, because as soon as you finish what's on your plate, you want more. All this goodness is served up with a heaping side of laid-back island hospitality, as friendly as can be."

Landshut's biggest attraction undoubtedly is the ''Landshut Wedding'', the re-enactment of the medieval wedding of George the Rich, Duke of Bavaria, and Hedwig Jagiellon, the eldest daughter of the King of Poland, in 1475. Basically the whole city becomes a stage, as the festival takes place all over town, with different venues like ''Trausnitz Castle'', the ''medieval city center'' and the ''Residence'', when over 2,300 actors (mostly Landshut residents) bring the Middle Ages to life. During the three weeks of the festivities, Landshut is flooded with over 700,000 visitors from all over the world and becomes a bustling medieval metropolis, when everyone gets carried away with medieval jousting, pageantry, feasting and knights' tournaments. It even became custom to the citizens of Landshut to wear hair and clothes to the fashion of the Middle Ages, even if they are not part of the acting crew. The downside of the spectacle obviously is, that accommodation gets extremely scarce within the city - however, the proximity to Munich provides a feasible lodging alternative."

The first Oktoberfest took place on the 12 Oct 1810, to celebrate the marriage of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Sachsen-Hildburghausen. All citizens of Munich were invited to a meadow (''Wiesn'') situated in front of the city tower, subsequently renamed ''Theresienwiese'' in honor of the bride. In the early years of the fair, horse races were held, then as the event grew, they added agricultural conventions, which still take place every fourth year. In 1896, businessmen working with the breweries in Munich built the first giant beer tents at ''Oktoberfest'', and drinking beer has been the primary focus ever since. Each of the major breweries presides over its own large tent filled with traditional musicians leading the crowd in well-known drinking chants, incredibly strong barmaids hoisting ten or more huge ''Maß'' (Pronounced 'Mass', these are one-litre glass beer mugs that are heavy even when empty!), and a spate of drunken people all trying to get into the bathroom at once. There are carnival games, amusement rides, and other entertainment available.

The ""kitchen"" half of the equation serves up a classed-up take on pub grub — one major standout from among the list of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers (mostly of the deep-fried variety), personal pizzas, and main-course salads is the ""Ultimate Chicken Sandwich"", where flavorful, well-seasoned grilled chicken comes topped with avocado, goat cheese, tomato, fresh basil, bacon, alfalfa sprouts, potato chips, and pesto mayo for a dazzlingly complex yet ultimately harmonious blend of flavors. A few heartier entrees are on offer as well, including a beer-battered fish fry made with the '''Southern Tier Brewing Company''''s ""One Buffalo"" American blonde ale — a huge seller on Fridays. As for the latter half of the surname, it's a bit of a misnomer — sure, you've got a pretty good selection of craft beers on tap from local and regional brewers such as the '''Hamburg Brewing Company''', '''12 Gates''', and '''Resurgence''', but also cocktails made with about 50 types of bourbon, Scotch and rye. In every aspect of the experience, Local does justice to its name — from the local craft brews, to the Western New York-based suppliers the kitchen uses in many of its recipes ('''Camellia Meats''' provides the ham for the Cuban sandwich and the ham and mozzarella melt, for example, while the jalapeño mustard for the soft pretzel appetizer comes from '''Deb's Delights'''), to the huge ""Buffalove"" sign adorning the back wall, even to the interior: wooden beams from an old barn in Clarence were reused here as wall paneling and to build the bar, for a rustic look redolent of nothing so much as an Old West saloon."

Don't miss the Loi Krathong festival, which in Chiang Mai lasts for 3 full days, the last night being that of the 12th full moon of the year (which is usually in Nov). In the small town of Mae Jo, north of Chiang Mai, they start the festival on Saturday night by simultaneously launching thousands upon thousands of hot air balloons called ''khom loi''. Loi Krathong coincides with the northern Thai (Lanna) festival known as ""Yi Peng"" (ยี่เป็ง). Due to a difference between the old Lanna calendar and the Thai calendar, Yi Peng is held on a full moon of the 2nd month of the Lanna calendar (""Yi"" meaning ""2nd"" and ""Peng"" meaning ""month"" in the Lanna language). A multitude of Lanna-style sky lanterns (khom loi (โคมลอย), literally: ""floating lanterns"") are launched into the air where they drift with the winds. The festival is meant as a time for ""tam-bun"" (ทำบุญ), to make merit. People decorate their houses, gardens, and temples with khom fai (โคมไฟ): intricately shaped paper lanterns which take on different forms. Khom thue (โคมถือ) are lanterns which are carried around hanging from a stick, khom khwaen (โคมแขวน) are the hanging lanterns, and khom pariwat (โคมปริวรรต) which are placed at temples and which revolve due to the heat of the candle inside. Chiang Mai has the most elaborate Yi Peng celebrations, where both Loi Krathong and Yi Peng are celebrated at the same time resulting in lights floating on the waters, lights hanging from trees/buildings or standing on walls, and lights floating by in the sky."

The dinosaurs, built by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins in the early 1850s to meet the emerging passion of wealthy Victorians for fossils and paleontology, they predated Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by six years and were unique in the world. After falling into a state of disrepair in the 1980s and 1990s they were splendidly renovated using a Lottery grant in the early 2000s and are now protected as a grade I listed structure.

Over a year later, in October 2015, the place finally opened for business. Was the painfully long wait worth it? Opinions are decidedly mixed, but at their best Hero can really dish out some mouthwatering fare — the classic ""Hero Burger"" is made with 100% hormone-free seasoned heritage Angus beef, the french fries are nice and crispy, and their take on poutine is true to the blue-collar, greasy-spoon roots of the dish (no hoity-toity duck confit topping or bone-broth gravy here, as at '''Blue Monk''' and '''Allen Street Poutine''' respectively). Unfortunately, it's not all the time that Hero is firing on all cylinders, and you're as likely as not to wait a half hour or more only to end up with over- or undercooked burgers that are missing half the toppings you ordered, served to you indifferently by scatterbrained staffers. Which scenario awaits you? You never can tell, but Hero might be worth your while if you're a burger fan who's in the mood to gamble. As for the menu, think of Hero as a decidedly more upscale '''Subway''' for burgers: you start with a patty made of beef, turkey, ground chicken, Alaskan salmon, or a vegetarian ""Soul Burger"", then choose from a selection of buns, cheeses, toppings, and sides, many of which are ""premium"" and therefore cost extra (whence the high prices that are another sticking point here). The dining room, while it's small and can get a bit cramped at peak hours, is pleasant, with a minimalist decor and abundant natural light courtesy of the large windows that look out onto beautiful Bidwell Parkway."

They moved to their current location in 1912, where Pastor Scott Lamont Johnson continues to lead weekly services for a small but vibrant and welcoming flock.

Fittingly, MTK — short for Midtown Kitchen, which took over the location after Malliaris' retirement in July 2015 — follows much the same model: one half of the building is an ultracool new nightspot, dimly lit with bluish-purple LED lights and dominated by a row of five flat-screen TVs hung up behind the bar in front of a majestic mural painted by local artist Chuck Tingley, while the other half is a small dining room, cozy and intimate yet bright and airy, where some of the best simple yet artfully concocted New American cuisine in town is served up. The setting comprises two all-glass walls (the one facing Elmwood Avenue is actually retractable; a sliding door of sorts, opened in the summer for something approximating an ''al fresco'' experience) as well as two walls covered with yet more Chuck Tingley mural artwork, and the culinary offerings comprise a selection that's heavy on shareable small plates (humbly undersold as ""snacks"" on the menu) plus some full-size mains. In the former category, one of MTK's most popular offerings is a beet salad with shishito peppers and pecorino cheese drizzled in pecan vinaigrette; in the latter, you can choose from a small but well-curated selection that includes a perfectly cooked 8-ounce hanger steak served with vegetables and ""MTK fries"" on the side, or fried chicken available either over garlic mashed potatoes or as a sandwich with homemade pickles, snap pea slaw and aioli on brioche. At MTK, locally sourced and/or homemade artisanal ingredients (mustard, pickles, and so forth) abound to a degree that's impressive even for the hoity-toity hipster hangouts of Elmwood, and a weekend brunch menu featuring several creative takes on the Bloody Mary is soon to come."

It was founded by king Volkashin in 1345 and finished by his son King Marko in 1366, who is also the donor of the frescoes painted between 1366 and 1371. It is unknown why the monastery is built in the vicinity of Skopje instead of Prilep the capital of their medieval kingdom. It is presumed that the grave of king Marko (who died in Romania fighting the Turks) is here but it was destroyed by the Turks. The architecture of the church is a cross in square with a central dome and a blind dome in the narthex. The elegant exonarthex (open porch) was added in 1830 by Hamzi Pasha, who was a generous donor of the monastery throughout the 19th century. It is quite surprising a Turkish aristocrat to be a donor of an Christian monument. The frescoes are work of more artists with different skills and are well preserved. Visible is the tendency for adding dramatization and narrative painting of the scenes. Most interesting is the unique scene '''The cry of Rahela''' (Mathew 2:18). On the southern façade the portraits of king Volkashin and king Marko are painted. -  While in the area also visit '''St.Bogorodica church''' (also referred as St.Nikola church) in Sushica village, built in the 13th century."

The museum is one of West Africa's best national museums and a top Nigerien attraction. There are many Hausa-styled pavilions containing displays on Nigerien history & customs and exhibitions focusing on such things as traditional instruments, palaeontology/archaeology, costumes, & uranium mining. The national zoo is depressing, mostly Sahelian animals. Other sites on the campus include traditionally-built dwellings, a small bar, and many handicrafts sellers. Bring water or buy it outside, as it is expensive inside. The exhibits and boutiques are closed in the afternoon 12:00-15:00 although during that time you can still see the animals and artisans.

Building started in 1883 and the church was consecrated only two years later. The towers were not finished before 1901 though, and the characteristic yellow and grey painting of the outside was done only in 1926. The design of the church was inspired by the Redemptorist church in Roosendaal and the (then new) Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Boston, while the interior, carried out in unpainted cedar wood, was a Surinamese design. Poor restoration efforts were undertaken in the late 1970's, leaving the building in need of new repairs shortly after. Finally, termite damage and severe tilting led to the closure of the cathedral in 1989 for safety reasons. The Vatican provided some funds for initial repairs in the mid 1990's and after fundraising efforts and a large EU grant, thorough restorations were carried out between 2007 and 2010. The cathedral was re-opened for the public in that year. Only the large organ, of which most of the pipes had been stolen, is still a work in progress."

Holding an additional rank of basilica, this cathedral venerates the Virgin Mary who reportedly appeared to Saint James the Apostle on said riverbank during his travels in Iberia. Mary appeared on a pillar, which led to her being venerated under this particular name and also gave origin to the unusual Spanish female given name ''Pilar''.<br>Saint James is believed to have had a small shrine constructed by the pillar, of which nothing remains, but subsequently a large basilica was built on the site in the 3rd century under the rule of the Roman Emperor Constantine. This basilica has seen many reconstructions over the years finally becoming a Gothic church in the 15th century. The present-day version of the church superseded it and was constructed on the orders of King Charles II of Spain between 1681 and 1872. The protracted construction has been caused by frequent redesigns, including a reorientation, additions of towers and cupolas. It also allowed for the domes to be painted by Francisco Goya a century after the construction started, and the vault paintings are now one of the main attractions on the inside of the cathedral."

Near the end of the 13 century, the royal family of Gaochang moved to Yongchang, Gansu. Around this same time, Buddhism in Turpan began to decline in popularity with the introduction of Islam. Subsequently, the religious importance of The Bizalkik Thousand Buddha Caves became less apparent. Many of the caves were destroyed during the ensuing religious clashes. Vandals dug out the eyes of many of the portraits human figures contained in the murals. Later, at the beginning of the 20 century, foreign explorers robbed the caves of much of the treasures.

There is no need to bring your own bike, because you can rent your bike upon arrival. Bike rentals are available adjacent to the JR station at Bizen Ichinomiya (upon exiting the station, the rental area is directly to the right). To reach Bizen-Ichinomiya from Okayama Station transfer to the 'Local lines' section. Two lines run on this track, so ask an attendant which train to take to Bizen-Ichinomiya if you are not sure. The ride should only take about 10 minutes. They will provide you with a map, although the entire trail is quite well-marked. Signs along the path have ""Kibiji District"" written on them in English and Japanese. You can return the bicycle at Soja station. The rental cost is ¥1,000 per bicycle per day. The sites along the trail are free, so expenses are quite nominal, making the cycling trail a '''highly affordable''' way to see a wide variety of cultural sites. The official estimated time to cycle the trail is two hours; however, if you take the time to thoroughly explore the sites, you can easily make it a half-day excursion, perhaps combining it with a visit to some of the other sites in the area. Although it is a cycling course, it is possible to use the trail for hiking. In order to see all the sites before evening, you should arrive at Bizen Ichinomiya Station no later than 10AM.

This has been interpreted as a message to the congregation to avoid working on the Sabbath.<br />Three holy wells in the churchyard attracted pilgrims in ancient times. People still visit the church to collect a little of the well water, or to pray.<br />The revival of interest in Celtic Christianity has prompted the development of “services of light” every three months in the church, focusing on Celtic spirituality and led by lay members of the congregation.

Its latest iteration opened in 2009, in the same building the shop was in when it last closed its doors in 1987, but the inventory on the shelves remains the same as ever: Our World was described in a ''Buffalo Rising'' writeup as being ""dedicated to a world of ethnic delights"", but really that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. Instead, the ''huge'' range of items stocked here are a magnificent reflection of the vitality of Buffalo's African-American community in all its facets. ""Diaspora gifts"" of all descriptions are the name of the game here: from African-inspired artwork, housewares, and decorative knickknacks, to toiletry items like black and shea butter soaps and a range of natural body oils and creams, to scarves, kaftans and other clothing. But if Our World's inventory has one singular strong point, it's literature — Bibles, Korans, and books touching on African-American themes abound; those interested in local African-American news and views can pick up copies of the ''Challenger'', ''Criterion'', or ''Final Call''; and, above all, they stock Buffalo's largest selection of Afrocentric greeting cards, with over a dozen series represented. The vivacious personality of Our World's owner is matched by the vivacious colors on the outer walls of the building: proud, bright reds, oranges, greens and blues, inspired in equal measures by the attractive storefronts of Elmwood Avenue and other fashionable shopping districts, as well as the vibrant hues of Africa. This place is truly one of a kind."

The Urban Trekking path, which these long walks through the city are now called, proceeds to Via della Fontanella, then Piazza Marconi, Piazzetta della Cella (where the earliest houses of local antiquity had been constructed) until you return to Piazza Duomo and there rest a moment and then travel by car or by bus to the archaeological site of Falerii and visit the Gate of Jupiter and the Church of Santa Maria in Falerii (12th-century), though perhaps this new tourist route is better to do the next day, if you'd like a more relaxed visit."

The tenth California Mission to be constructed, it was consecrated in 1786 as the first of Father Lasuen's nine missions. Today, Mission Santa Barbara is both a scenic wonder and a fine anthropological study of original native culture in the surrounding area. Santa Barbara is the only California mission with twin bell towers, owing to its status as a cathedral in the early days of California statehood. It also has had a longer continuous association with the Franciscans than any other mission, and a longer continuous history of choral music than any other mission. The headquarters of the mission system in the 1830s and 40s, it is where many of the archives concerning the California missions are held. The presence of the mission inspired the city of Santa Barbara to build its buildings primarily in the Mission Revival style. Well worth a visit, note the adjacent pottery kiln and tanning vat ruins."

Prices for anything more substantial than a plate of rice will be quoted in US dollars. The Cambodian Central Bank maintains the riel at approximately 3,900–4,100 to the dollar. Be wary if rates are outside this range. Money changers are plentiful near the central market and display their rates on boards.  Only up market places will accept plastic (normally with a 3% surcharge). Changing dollars into riel is generally unnecessary, though the parsimonious will notice a small benefit. Small purchases with notes above USD20 can cause problems, though vendors will manage. Do not worry if a vendor runs off with your large note, they are finding change not robbing you. Torn, damaged, or old series US currency may not be accepted.  There are plenty of ATMs. They dispense US dollars and accept international cards. Canadia Bank and Mekong Bank ATMs were fee-free but no longer as of the end of 2014. MB Bank (St 93 cnr St 214) doesn't charge and allows up to $1,000 withdrawal (July 2016).  Maybank also doesn't charge, but it accepts only Visa cards. Otherwise typical charges are $5 regardless of amount withdrawn, typically $500 is the maximum. Both ANZ Royal bank and Canadia bank charge USD5 per transaction, max single withdrawal $500. For safety reasons, it's a good idea to use ATMs at actual bank branches when they are open so any problems can immediately be reported and there is often a security guard on duty too. It also gives the opportunity to ask for smaller notes, such as 20s or 10s which are much easier to spend and get change back from and little risk of picking up counterfeit notes . The Mekong Bank at 220 Sisowath Quay are happy to change big notes to smaller ones or change damaged notes.  Cashing traveller's cheques can be problematic. Even major banks may refuse to exchange traveller's cheques above USD100."

There is an old African saying which goes something like this; “once you get the dust of Africa on your boots, you will never be able to kick it off”. In other words; once you experience Africa, it will be in your heart forever. Wildlife is in danger all over the world, and especially in Africa. Photographic safari camps are one of the best ways to save wildlife as they; bring tourists in for the best safari explore, create jobs for locals, which makes both parties (the tourists and the locals) value their wildlife and habitat which helps save the animals for the whole world.

Appropriately enough, it was on New Year's Eve that the ribbon was cut on William K's. Located next to '''The Hatch''' just past the entrance to the marina (there's always ample parking in the huge lot across Erie Street), William K's dining room is gifted with spectacular views over Lake Erie and across the mouth of the Buffalo River to the historic lighthouse — but unlike some other waterfront restaurants that are content to sell themselves based on scenery, this place follows through with food that's a cut above the competition in quality, elegance, and price. The menu here is smallish and could be described as an especially innovative take on the upscale steak-and-seafood template with the balance tipped decidedly in favor of the latter: the grilled Spanish octopus over chorizo and chickpea stew is a tantalizing combination of flavors and textures, and a changing selection of fresh seafood from the Gloucester Fish Market comprises the ""Boston's Finest"" seafood platter. Elsewhere on the menu, you've got a variety of steaks and chops, a roasted beet salad topped with burrata, masala milk powder, and locally sourced honey that's arguably the most popular item on the menu, and — for those with a smaller budget to work with — a selection of thin-crust brick-oven pizzas with some very interesting toppings (how about bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, fresh horseradish, and pecorino romano cheese?) Portions tend to be a bit on the small side for the money, but the service is unfailingly attentive and friendly, and there's an extensive wine list and some great craft cocktails at the bar."

It was also referred to as Marketplace Square because that was its use. The square was named for Henry Ellis, second Royal Governor. Unfortunately, in 1954, this entire square, on Barnard Street between W. Bryan and W. Congress Streets, was covered by a city parking garage. This parking garage was torn down in 2007 and is being replaced by an underground parking structure, Savannah's first, with Ellis Square restored on top.  **On the west side of Ellis Square, the City Market complex extends for two blocks over to Franklin Square. Ellis was the site of the Old City Market, which was demolished in the early 1950s to make way for the infamous parking garage. The loss of the Old City Market upset residents to the extent that efforts began to prevent further losses of irreplaceable buildings."

Michele's serves breakfast and lunch, with a menu that looks like ordinary diner fare at first blush but later, on closer inspection, reveals itself to be subtly indebted to the cuisines of a wide variety of the different ethnic groups that have called this part of town home. This is especially true of the breakfast menu: omelettes come in standard permutations like Western or ham and cheese, but there's also a chicken and feta omelette that pairs perfectly with ""Greek home fries"" (with onion, peppers, mushrooms, and feta) on the side; soul food specialties like chicken and waffles are a nod to the African-American communities on the nearby East Side; Michele's take on the breakfast burrito replaces spicy ground chorizo with smoked Polish sausage. There are fewer surprises on the lunch side of the equation — hamburgers, wraps, melt sandwiches, and main-course salads rule the day, with souvlaki the only lunchtime offering with a real ethnic identity — but it should be said that the burgers Michele's grills up continue the '50s-throwback theme established in the decor. No prepackaged, frozen patties here: these burgers are handmade and grilled to perfection with your choice of toppings, plus a pickle on the side and either French fries or soup. The fries, sadly, are identical to the stuff you can pick up in the frozen food section of any supermarket, but if the soup of the day happens to be chicken noodle, you're in for a real Polish-style treat — it's make in-house from scratch and bursting with flavor, with ''kluski'' noodles and coarsely chopped chunks of carrot and celery. The only real sore point is the service, which while not outright bad, is not especially friendly or attentive."

Depending on your level of interest, a visit to the museum can be anywhere from one hour to most of the day. The central building was the old town theater, long vacant after being bombed during the Spanish Civil War. Even art fans who are otherwise lukewarm to Dalí's general artistry can find visiting here a rewarding experience, and may come out with new appreciation for the eccentric genius. The museum also contains displays of other Catalan artists, and Dalí's personal collection of work, ranging from old masters to Marcel Duchamp. Note that Dalí's most famous work, 'The Persistence of Memory ', is not in this museum, but in New York City's Museum of Modern Art. Many other major works were removed by Spanish authorities shortly after his death and displayed in the Prado, in Madrid.<br>'''Usage tips:''' Reservation is ''not'' essential, but it will likely save you from spending half an hour in a queue. There's lot of coin-operated gadgets all around the museum--therefore, take as much change as you have when you leave your belongings to a cloakroom; ask personnel to change banknotes if you don't have enough. Most famous example is ''Rain Taxi'' in the center of the courtyard for 1€. Plus you can have audioguide for 1€ per room--although Dalí's original concept was to not allow ''any'' guides explaining anything to visitors: they should understand as much as they're able to without help. Also note that visitors to the museum are extremely heavy during the summer months. Weekends are best avoided as the experience will not be pleasant. Also to be avoided are cloudy days in the summer as those on a beach holiday will inevitably make a trip to the museum to be their day event as the beach is less than ideal."

The uprising started right after the death of an American CIA Agent. There is a plaque commemorating his death but nothing about the hundreds of more Afghans that were killed in the hours afterwards. After the fall of Mazar-e Sharif to Warlord General Dostum and western advisors, truckloads of Taliban prisoners were herded into the fortress. The fortress is divided into two sections. The walls are sloping inwards from the outside and vertical from the inside, probably a strong reason why the Taliban were not able to scale the walls and escape after capturing weapons, and why the Afghan and western soldiers were able to trap them in their area by sealing the one exit/entry point and controlling the walls. To get in you will need to find a local to fast talk the guards. There is no entrance fee as the fortress is not a tourist attraction (Entrance fees are rare in Afghanistan anyway). Walking the interior (if you get in) and perimeter is easy. There are fields near the main road giving some space between it and the fortress so photography is best from that side if you want to get wide-angle shots. The fortress is used by the new Afghan military and they are not too keen on having ordinary tourists turning up for a look around, although if you arrive with a local they can talk you in and the guards do warm up (and want photos sent back to them). UN and other NGO tourists have less hassle wanting to look around. A few rusting anti-air machine guns are next to the gate that divides the fortresses two areas."

The newly rechristened Black Sheep builds on the pan-European eclecticism of its former iteration with a menu that, while not much longer than Bistro Europa's, is even more wide-ranging and upscale than before (with prices to match). This expansion is a reflection of the expansion of its staff, kitchen facilities, and above all, dining room: The Black Sheep seats about 70 people, more than double the old place, and the capacity is expanded further in the summer months thanks to a large, pleasant rear patio. As always, the accent here is on locally-sourced produce, meat, poultry, and dairy products, which figure into the smoked pork chop entree that comes with a side of heirloom grits and braised greens. As for appetizers, the cheese and charcuterie plates that were so popular at Europa are still on hand (courtesy of Buffalo's own '''Nickel City Cheese & Mercantile'''), along with new innovations such as a sweet-and-savory watermelon gazpacho that comes with kaffir lime granita.

Earlier, 318 priests had been hacked to death nearby by a mob on 3 September 1792. The church underwent significant restoration in the 19th century, ensuring the preservation of the building, which by that date represented a fascinating mix of styles: 6th century marble columns placed alongside Gothic vaults and supported by Romanesque arches.

(Festival fans need not worry: either Carl himself or his food truck, '''The Wine Wanderer''', can still be found at many local events.)

Chateau Buffalo has its own urban winery, bottling a variety of white and red vintages that they produce in small batches from locally-grown grapes, and they also make their own craft cider under the brand name ""Dancing Buffalo"" (the German-style ''apfelwein'' is said to be especially tasty). Better still, the balance of their inventory, which also includes mead, cheese, jams, jellies, and other goods, is sourced from other New York artisans — so if you're in search of a hard-to-find craft product from elsewhere in the state, you may be in luck at Chateau Buffalo. ""Charcuterie Friday"" is a great time to show up at the store: $25 buys a flight of wine or cider for two plus a rotating slate of New York-made artisan cheeses and sausages; call ahead at least 24 hours in advance to reserve a plate.

But Providence Social is the real deal. At the helm is chef/owner Josh Hanzlian, whose local credibility is beyond reproach: his stepfather is the late, great Buffalo Sabres winger Rick Martin, and another branch of his family owns '''Hanzlian's Homemade Sausage''' in Pine Hill. Hanzlian describes the cuisine served at Providence Social as a ""new American fusion"" where the focus is on tapas and small plates (though a small range of full-size mains is also available), and in a recent write-up in ''Buffalo Rising'' said he ""want[s] this [restaurant] to be a social experience"", hence its name. The food here consists of tried-and-true favorites with creative twists: nachos are topped with duck confit and lime-infused crème fraîche, sliders are made with ground lamb and boast a salsa of cucumbers and toasted sesame seeds, and the stuffed poblano peppers — arguably the most popular item on the menu — are filled with a mélange of aged cheeses and stone-cut oats, crusted with an olive panko breading, and served at dinner with a red pepper chipotle cream sauce and at brunch on Sundays with a side of eggs and toast. Indeed, reviewers reserve special praise for the Sunday brunch here, with $1 mimosas on offer.

"Buffalo/East Side | eat | Bailey Fish & Seafood | Bailey Fish, Seafood, the East Side, Fridays, Buffalo, daily, the United States, Bailey Seafood, the ""Haddock Super Sandwich, Costanzo, French, Bailey Seafood, crawfish, Southern, Bailey Seafood's, mac & cheese","Bailey Fish and Seafood is the only seafood restaurant on the East Side — and the only one it needs. There's no indoor seating here, so you'll have to take your food back to the hotel with you, often braving seemingly endless lines to do so (especially on Fridays, when their topnotch fish fry packs the house) — but it's worth it. Why? Simply put, the food here is ''really, really good'': the freshest, tastiest seafood Buffalo has to offer, with shipments of high-quality product arriving daily from all over the United States. The marquee item at Bailey Seafood is the ""Haddock Super Sandwich"", a feast that truly lives up to its superlative name: a gargantuan fried filet on a locally baked '''Costanzo's''' bun, topped with tangy coleslaw and homemade French fries, big enough for two people to share yet at a price of only $5. This and other sandwiches are frequently ordered in combos (or, for larger parties, ""family packs"") where the already excellent value for your money is improved further. Dinnertime at Bailey Seafood sees mains like breaded shrimp, grilled shrimp skewers, crawfish, steamed clams, and various fish filets served ''à la carte'' or in combo packs, and they even sell fresh fish and one-, two-, and five-pound packs of shrimp, crab legs, and oysters if you're planning an event. Meanwhile, the slate of appetizers and sides is where the Southern and Creole influences that pervade Bailey Seafood's menu come out best: try the hush puppies, mac & cheese, fried okra, or homemade sweet potato pie if you want a sample. Service is quick and friendly especially considering the unrelenting crowds the staff has to deal with; if you want to make it easier on them and yourself, you can call ahead or order online and they'll have your food waiting for you when you arrive."

The Newtown Compound is one of the last surviving examples of municipal compounds for black male workers. The City Council built the compound in 1913 to house migrant workers who worked first for the Sanitary Department and then later at the nearby power station.     The Museum tells the story of Migrant Labourers who came to Johannesburg to find work. Having left their homes and families, black migrant workers faced slave-like conditions shown by the original dormitories, concrete bunks and punishment room at the old compound building. The museum reveals the hardships of workers under the migrant labour system, a cornerstone of apartheid, from the early 1900s through to the 1970s, when the system of job reservation began to breakdown. More positively it shows the vibrancy and creative resilience of migrant worker's culture. Oral history interviews and individual stories are combined with archival photographs and documents as well as a newly commissioned documentary on Migrant Labour."

Outside on the upper part, there are 48 pointed windows in three levels. On the lower part, a gate was cut and turned to a baptismal chapel in 1931.

And it's true: while a decade or so ago you were hard-pressed to find them outside the rural hinterlands, today there are a dozen or more of them inside the city limits, with more sprouting each year. The Clinton Bailey Farmers' Market is not one of the newbies, though: founded in 1930 as an outgrowth of the wholesale food distributors across the street at the '''Niagara Frontier Food Terminal''', it's by far the oldest and largest farmers' market in Buffalo, and the only one that remains open year round (though with sharply reduced hours in winter). At Clinton Bailey, you'll find stall after stall of growers and vendors each specializing in something a little different from their neighbor: booths manned by friendly folks with a knack for service, a genuine desire to steer their customers to the products they're searching for, and above all, an encyclopedic knowledge of the goods they grow or produce themselves — whether it be fresh fruits or vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants, baked goods, or other specialty foods. There's even a small flea market on weekends in summer with jewelry and other goods. Prices are astoundingly low even compared to other area farmers' markets. No matter what time of year you come, the Clinton Bailey Farmers' Market is an enjoyable and distinctly local experience: late fall sees the lot awash with green as local tree farms come on the scene to sell fresh-cut Christmas trees, then the market settles in for the winter with just a few diehard greenhouse farmers holding out in the market's enclosed interior space. Needless to say, though, summer is when you want to come — participants during the warm months include everyone from industrial farms hundreds of acres (hectares) in size to small family farms and hobby growers selling seedlings out of the back of their pickup trucks."

The current building, faced in buff brick and boasting exquisite Classical detailing, was built in 1919 after a fire claimed the original wooden church. At Seneca Street United Methodist, the name of the game is charitable generosity and community service: according to its mission statement, its dedication to ""working to bring Christ to the people of the Seneca-Babcock neighborhood"" encompasses the nurturing of its ""spiritual, educational, emotional, and physical growth"". While the '''Seneca Community Development Corporation''', located on the same site, sees to the latter three — notably, with after-school programs for inner-city youth that include academic tutoring, job training, music lessons, cooking classes, and group outings — Pastor Brian Rotach helms the spiritual end, with services on Sunday evenings that are preceded by a free dinner at 3PM and followed at 5:15PM by a cornucopia of baked goods and other treats donated from area supermarkets."

A grandiose piece of art by Mimar Sinan, the Ottoman architect of 16th century, Selimiye is usually considered the zenith of Ottoman architecture and has been listed as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2011. Sinan himself considered this building as his best work. The dome of the building, which hangs high over main hall, encloses a huge space which gives the place an expansive atmosphere, had the largest diameter (31.28 mt) of all domes in the world for several centuries. And its minarets (towers) are the second highest minarets (70.89 mt) in whole world, surpassed only by Qutb Minar (72.50 mt) in Delhi, India. The mosque has 999 windows in total, which according to its architect Sinan, symbolize the perfectness of God, through the imperfectness of the mosque he designed. The dome and interior walls are decorated with calligraphy and geometrical designs, most of which are painted in hues of pink and blue. If you have admired Blue Mosque (Sultanahmet Mosque) of Istanbul, you’ll sure adore this one, since Blue Mosque is quite a copy of Selimiye. The upside down tulips, which are some sort of symbol of Edirne have their origin in a tulip illustration engraved on a marble in the fountain right under the central dome of Selimiye. It is believed to symbolize the landlord of the tulip garden on which the mosque was built, who was said to be reluctant to give over his garden."

Founded in 1889, the facility's original buildings collapsed in the ""San Francisco Earthquake"" of 1906, killing 117 people. The new buildings, including the still-standing auditorium, clock tower and superintendent's residence, are good examples of early twentieth century Mediterranean Revival architecture, heavily influenced by the Arts and Crafts style. The new buildings represented a more modern attitude toward the mentally ill. The smaller buildings with larger windows were designed to comfort and stimulate the mentally ill, rather than imprison them. The state of California moved the last few hundred residents out in the mid 1990s, and sold the campus to Sun Microsystems, who promised to preserve the grounds and buildings, and make the auditorium and executive mansion available for public events.

The pavilion and the gardens around it were improved over the next couple of centuries as a pleasure garden used by local officials and, on occasions, visiting emperors. The Qianlong Emperor loved the island so much that he added a replica to the imperial resort in Chengde. A regular ferry takes visitors to and from the island and also calls at the other main sights around the lake. The pavilion itself was last rebuilt in 1918, but is furnished largely as it was in the 19th century. Some subsidiary buildings house exhibitions. Of particular interest to Chinese Communists is a traditional wooden canal boat permanently moored at the island, a replica of a boat that served as the venue for the Communist Party of China's first conference in 1921, after the delegates escaped the police in Shanghai to continue their meeting.

The rehabilitation of the four block area began in 1985. The result is a physical facility that economically could not be replicated today. City Market has established itself as a destination for entertainment, dining, and retailing in downtown Savannah. To create an anchor attraction that would attract both tourists and Savannah residents, the developer emulated its successful Torpedo Factory project in Alexandria, Virginia and established the Art Center at City Market. This group of working studios for artists occupies approximately 19,000 square feet of space and has created an opportunity for other tenants of City Market to establish and operate viable food, entertainment, and retail businesses. In addition, City Market has three apartments and approximately 11,000 square feet of office space. The new Ellis Square opened in March of 2010 is immediately west of City Market and has an interactive fountain, information kiosk & a new underground 1100 space parking garage making it very easy to park in the heart of the historic & tourist area."

The façade along the river Rhône is over 300 m (984 ft) long. The first hospital was built in 1184-1185; it was modified several times before Soufflot designed the current building, built from 1741 to 1761. The large dome was completed in 1765. The newly built Grange Blanche hospital (today Edouard Herriot) became the main medical centre in the city in the 1930s. Hôtel-Dieu doctors were pioneers in numerous specialities, including radiology (Etienne Destot), oncology (Léon Bérard), surgery (Joseph Gensoul, Matthieu Jaboulay) and orthopedics (Louis Léopold Ollier); they contributed in making Lyon the second medical centre in the country after Paris. The building no longer fits the needs of modern medicine, therefore the hospital has been closed down in 2010. Its future is not completely clear; it should be at least partially converted into a luxury hotel and shopping mall. <br>Hôtel-Dieu hosts the '''Lyon hospitals museum''' (''Musée des Hospices civils de Lyon'')."

The town was fully submerged by a diversion of the Bridge River by the Terzaghi Dam into Seton Lake, via a tunnel through Mission Mountain. This diversion formed Carpenter Lake. When water levels are low in late fall and winter, the remains of Minto emerge from the lake and people can explore what is left of the town, namely its street grid as nearly all structures and foundations are gone.

ABV's lengthy menu incorporates burgers of dry-aged, grass-fed, hormone-free Angus beef ordered by number — standouts include #2, which betrays the local delicacy of beef on weck as its inspiration with its slather of caraway horseradish aioli and its side of au jus, and the ineffable #5, topped with bacon, jalapeños, and peanut butter — as well as ""alternative burgers"" made from pretty much every kind of ground meat (and meat substitute) imaginable, from lamb and chorizo to salmon and chickpea fritters. Sides include a variety of gourmet mac-and-cheese platters, truffle fries, and an upscale take on poutine that holds its own with the '''Allen Street Poutine Company''' down the street. And it's not for nothing that this place shares an acronym with the phrase ""alcohol by volume"": while it's not quite as expansive or eclectic as '''Blue Monk''', ABV's beer list is impressive, with an emphasis on craft beers from the local area and elsewhere around the Northeast plus a few West Coast microbrews and imports thrown in for good measure. As for ambience, ABV has a dimly-lit, ""Brooklyn hipster bar"" feel whose idiosyncratic interior has been described in ''Buffalo Rising'' as ""medieval meets the farm"": seating is at long, warehouse-style tables and benches made of salvaged wood, walls are covered from floor to ceiling in vinyl album covers, and found objects are employed in novel ways as decorative baubles. Sadly, for all its ambition, ABV's execution is uneven — in terms of food quality, diners report everything from delicious perfection to burgers served half-raw, and service is clueless as often as not — but keep in mind that the place has only been open a month as of this writing, so it's equally likely that these kinks will be worked out in time."

The final mile is a grueling trek up granite steps, followed by wire cables that lead up the steep ascent to the top of Half Dome. Hikers should bring leather work gloves to protect their hands from the cables; some gloves are often available in a pile at the bottom of the cables. While it is possible to ascend Half Dome while the cables are down (between approximately October 15 and May 15), hikers do so at their own risk.

Though Sinatra's has remained true to its original dedication to delicious Sicilian and Southern Italian food, over the years it has become more known as an upscale destination serving an increasingly refined interpretation of that cuisine. A wide range of pasta dishes are on offer, made with fine ingredients imported from Italy; the pasta con sardi is an interesting choice in this regard, topped with fresh sardines, tomatoes, raisins, fennel and pine nuts. A range of seafood dishes is also available at Sinatra's, as well as chicken and veal served in milanese, marsala, piccata, parmigiana or diavolo style.

The Russians were soon on the offensive, but the castle withstood several sieges before capitulating in 1714.  The Swedes recaptured it in 1721, but lost it again in 1743, and it stayed in Russian hands ever since.  This also explains why it has stayed in such good shape: for the Russians, it was far inland and militarily useless, and hence not a target for the enemy either.Today, Olavinlinna is the world's northernmost medieval stone castle and easily Finland's best-preserved and most attractive castle, and it's quite a sight perched on the shores of the lake.

It sleeps 16 guests in beds, 11 individually. Building a frame house in Breckenridge before the arrival of the railroad was no small task. To erect this c. 1881 house and the one next door (301 N. Main), Breckenridge saloonkeeper Joseph F. Reeder had to chop down trees, drag them to the sawmill, have them milled for different uses — siding, flooring, shingles, etc. — and let them dry. Inflating the cost of construction was the need to pack finished building materials — nails, paint, and doors — over a high mountain pass at a cost of forty cents per pound. In 1888, John Williams, a hardrock miner, and his wife, Minta, purchased the house as their home. After John and Minta’s separation in 1890, Minta and their daughter, Ethel, continued to live here until 1906, renting it out from time to time as they pursued an acting career for Ethel.

It is the only building from the Graeco-Roman world which has remained substantially intact and in continuous use throughout to the present day, and as it is still a functioning church, silence is requested during your visit. The Pantheon is celebrated for its large dome. From inside you'll see traces of the former bronze ceiling, melted down during the reign of Pope Urban VIII to make weapons for the fortification of the Castel Sant' Angelo. The hole in the center of the ceiling, though, is an original feature designed for architectural reasons (the dome would collapse without it.) If it happens to be '''raining''', you should definitely go to the Pantheon to see the rain pouring into the building through the hole in the ceiling. There are holes in the ground that drain the water. The spectacular doors are Romans, but not the original. The original bronze beams of the pronao were melted down by Pope Urban VIII and might have been used to create Bernini's Baldacchino, or canopy, in Saint Peter's. The dome is the largest masonry dome in the world, larger than that of Saint Peter. The building now appears to be built in a depression, but this was not the original appearance. The street level at the sides and rear has risen about 10 meters since the original construction due to the accumulation of debris from 2,000 years of settlement. This has necessitated the maintenance of the deep trench that keeps the building from being buried."

Almost as storied as the history of the church itself is the history of the welfare institutions it's sponsored for the local area: from the community grocery store it ran in the Depression years to its status as the first black church in Buffalo to evangelize over the radio airwaves beginning in the 1940s, and right through today with the community educational initiatives, food banks, and other programs maintained by Reverend Edward Jackson. But of course, the Sunday morning services, where longtime members as well as visitors are welcome to a seat at the table, remain the heart and soul of Friendship Baptist — they take place in a brick building dating from 1954 that, like the congregation itself, blends tradition with modernity."

Why, then, does Buffalo not have a huge German festival to match its '''Italian Festival''', '''St. Patrick's Day Parade''', '''Dyngus Day''', ad nauseam?

Having lacked a congregation since the 1980s as more and more of the local Jews left for larger cities of the country and for Israel, it stayed in a heavily ruined state since then, until 2015 when it was restored with a colourful look inside out and re-opened with a service. In one of the side alleys of Kaleiçi lies a small stone church, used to be where the Catholic community of the city held masses, though a part of a local primary school (''İstiklal İlköğretim Okulu'') nowadays.

From 1974 to 1997 the Opry House was part of a theme park called Opryland USA, which closed due to low attendance and was subsequently torn down and replaced with a mega-shopping mall called Opry Mills. Rumors that the Opry is haunted persist to this day as more than 35 people closely associated with the Opry have been met with untimely deaths.

Flash forward a few months and its successor, Margie's, presents for the aficionado of downhome Southern cooking a scenario that's much the same as before — and, let's hope, a fate much different. Margie Hawkins is the eponymous owner/chef who brings to bear decades of familiarity with the savory ways of the cuisine of the American South that dates back to her childhood days, which she spent cooking for a crowded house of 21 brothers and sisters in her hometown of Selma, Alabama. Now, six days a week at the Market, she cooks up the most authentic takes on fried chicken (a breast and wing cooked to perfection: crispy on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside), mac & cheese (as sinfully greasy and gooey as anything you'll find in the Deep South), barbecue ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender with a delightful tinge of raspberry in the glaze), and peach cobbler that you can find anywhere in the Niagara Frontier. Yes, just like before, but along with the aforementioned holdovers from McKenzie's menu are more esoteric regional specialties like pigs' trotters and oxtail that are worth a try if you're in a more adventurous mood. If you've ever been down South to a ""meat and three"" joint, the setup will be instantly familiar to you, but at Margie's it's ""meat and two"" — that is, you choose from a meat-based main course and two side dishes, plus cornbread and a biscuit, served to you cafeteria-style in styrofoam takeout containers for a flat price of $8. It doesn't get better than this."

Despite the fact that its building lacks the architectural majesty of many of Polonia's older churches, St. John Kanty counts a congregation that's among the East Side's most vibrant — aside from the half-dozen Masses held here each week, the church remains a powerful force in Buffalo's Polish community through its sponsorship of a bevy of community services for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. It continues to grow, too, accepting the former members of '''St. Adalbert's Basilica''' into the fold when the two churches merged in 2011."

The teodolite survey and photographs of the underground cavities were made. The Commission studied all the underpasses,the existence of which was known then: both those just found and those which had already been used for a long time by enterprising merchants for storing various goods: textiles,wines and food. They explored underground galleries, rooms, passes and made up a preliminary description of what they saw. - The NKVD-KGB secret police carefully recorded and placed on the secret list all the documents on the underpasses, especially after 1956 when a secret order on the underground caves, passes, shelters, etc. was issued, as the Soviet Union started to prepare bombshelters in case of the nuclear war.

After 16 years as owner of '''Soho Burger Bar''' just down the block, Jay Manno jumped at the chance to open a second Chippewa Street eatery that would serve up some of the Italian food he grew up with — simple yet creatively conceived and well-executed specialties from his ancestral homelands of Sicily and Campania — in the former home of '''City Tavern''', whose old-school interior, with its exposed brick, warm-toned woodwork, and original tin ceiling, was a perfect match for the ""Little Italy-type restaurant"" he envisioned. Even the ""+39"" suffix in the restaurant's name is a subtle nod to his roots, being Italy's telephone calling code. The backbone of Frankie Primo's is a deceptively straightforward-seeming yet wide-ranging range of pizzas (fired in a brick oven; not too greasy, with a thin, crispy crust), pasta dishes (including the Roman specialty ''cacio di pepe'', the only place in Buffalo where you can find it), panini sandwiches (served on fresh, crusty ciabatta bread baked in-house), and main-course salads (the ''cavolo toscano'' is especially interesting; a heaping mound of kale topped with currants, toasted pine nuts, pecorino romano cheese, and lemon vinaigrette), which come in ample portions and at prices that aren't half bad for what you get. About a dozen specialty cocktails are served up at the homey bar — classics like Negronis and Manhattans, plus more newfangled creations that still betray a strong classicist influence — and if you prefer your drinks at the table with dinner, the wine selection is encyclopedic."

It was erected in honour of victory over Goths by either Claudius II Gothicus (reigned 268-270) or Constantine the Great (reigned 306-337), and it likely is the oldest artefact dating back to Roman era that is still intact in the city and possibly pre-dates the foundation of Constantinople, with some badly deformed Latin inscriptions on its pedestal. Also near the café is the ruins of a monastery dating back to Byzantine times. The park has two gates, one near Sultanahmet (on the street between Sultanahmet Sq and Sirkeci, the street on which trams run), and the other on the avenue lying on the coastline. To get to Sirkeci/Eminönü from the latter, turn left after exiting the park."

As you enter the complex, the first major structure on your right is the bulbous, octagonal '''tomb of Iza Khan''', a court noble who built it in his own lifetime, some 20 years before Humayun's tomb. As you pass through the first gate, you will glimpse the dome of the tomb and enter a floral path leading to the second (West) gate, which now acts as the entrance to the giant central garden. - The centrepiece is the eponymous '''tomb of Humayun''', the second Mughal emperor. Built starting in 1562, it was the first major Mughal structure in the city and has been described as a predecessor or prototype of Agra's Taj Mahal. The structures are, indeed, stylistically similar, although Humayun's Tomb is built from red sandstone, not white marble, and was built by a wife grieving for her husband, not the other way around. You can climb up to the second level (the stairs on the west side are very steep, those on the south side less so), and on the south side you will find the entrance into the main crypt where Humayun is buried. Before you leave, be sure to visit the South Gate, the original royal entrance, from where you can get picture-postcard views without too many tourists in the way. In the southeast corner is the '''Barber's Tomb''', also built in the same style. Historians do not know who is buried in this picturesque tomb made of red and grey sandstone."

The restaurants and piers of Çengelköy offer some of the best panoramas along the Bosphorus, including a view on the old city under the first Bridge. The neighborhood was popular amongst TV directors during the 70s and in recent decades it has become a (possibly the most) popular location to have lunch or dinner on the eastern side of Istanbul. In recent years many historic mansions have been restored and multiple boutique chocolatiers were opened. Most restaurants in Çengelköy don't offer alcoholic beverages. Exceptions include the restaurant at the main pier (Iskele), and Tapasuma, the restaurant of hotel 'Sumahan on the Water', located in a former Ottoman Raki distillery. You can get there by taking bus 15 or 15F from Üsküdar, it is just a few stops further than Beylerbeyi. Going to Çengelköy by car is not advised; traffic can be very intense on the narrow road along this side of the Bosphorus."

Naturally sheltered by the rocky spits and shallows of La Penouille and Sandy Beach, nineteen warships were based here, serving a key role in waging the '''Battle of the St. Lawrence''' which saw 23 Allied vessels sunk by German subs off Canada's east coast.

Suburban legends aside, it can be scary to drive on, especially at night in the rain. To get here from Uptown, take Hadley Street east, turn left onto Painter Avenue, and turn right onto Beverly Boulevard. Beverly turns into Turnbull Canyon Road.

Both castles were reinforced by the Moors, who also built the walls connecting the fort with the town below. After the Christian Reconquista further renovations were carried out, and the Upper Castle was used for a time as a jail for political prisoners. In the 18th century the castle suffered serious damage first during the Spanish War of Succession, and later from an earthquake in 1748, after which it fell into disuse.

Named for the Yoruba goddess of the sea, here a range of amazingly creative seafood concoctions are plated up with aplomb by a staff of servers that really knows their stuff. Oshun also has one of the most delicious raw bars you've ever seen, featuring between eight and ten changing varieties of shucked-to-order oysters from all over the world. The menu consists mostly of small plates — if you're dining with a group, they say it's best to order two to three selections per person and pass them around to share — and boasts standouts such as a creative take on calamari (coated with a pineapple tamarind glaze and topped with a grilled corn salsa), seared bay scallops over coconut rice topped with popcorn (it works, surprisingly), and delectable king crab, lobster, and fish dishes. For those who don't like seafood, grilled short ribs, Jamaican-style jerk chicken served with plantain fritters, and other land-based entrees call to mind the Cajun fare Guarino serves at '''Shango'''. At the bar is served an ample selection of wines, creative cocktails, and a slate of regional craft brews. Best of all at Oshun, though, is the decor: the extensive renovation not only preserved original Art Deco interior elements such as the frescoes on the wall, but enhanced them with modern touches for an upscale ambience that blends the Roaring Twenties with the 21st Century in luxurious style: an Atlantean decadence that seems a world away from Buffalo."

However, meddling from city officials resulted in that plan being tweaked, and what was built instead rather resembles '''Delaware Park''' in miniature: a large lake in the middle, a small Meadow that's presently the site of the 9-hole '''South Park Golf Course''', and an ornamental garden, greenhouse and arboretum that eventually grew into the '''Buffalo & Erie County Botanical Gardens''', the park's marquee attraction (see below). Like Cazenovia, time has been much kinder to South Park than to most other Olmsted parks around the city, remaining true to its original design save for the intrusion of the golf course in 1915 and the construction of a turnaround loop for public buses in the 1940s. Among the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy's plans is the revitalization of '''South Park Lake''', which has unfortunately served almost as an afterthought to the park's other features; when work is done, word is it may once again be deep enough for boating."

Until about 40 years ago, Austrian football was dominated by a large number of Viennese clubs. Since then, their strength has faded, reflecting the overall decline of Austrian football compared to other European football. Today, only two Viennese clubs are left in the Austrian top football division, Rapid Vienna and Austria Magna. Rapid has won the Austrian league 31 times, more than any other club. They are known as the people's club, having working class roots and regularly attracting fairly big crowds of around 15,000. Home fixtures are played at the Gerhard-Hanappi-Stadion.

Today, Mission Santa Barbara is both a scenic wonder and a fine anthropological study of original native culture in the surrounding area. Santa Barbara is the only California mission with twin bell towers, owing to its status as a cathedral in the early days of California statehood. It also has had a longer continuous association with the Franciscans than any other mission, and a longer continuous history of choral music than any other mission. The headquarters of the mission system in the 1830s and 40s, it is where many of the archives of the California missions are held. Note the adjacent pottery kiln and tanning vat ruins."

Inspired by the 1893 World Fair in Chicago, the Seminary owner decided to build 10 buildings of styles around the world including a Greek theater, a Japanese pagoda, and a Dutch windmill. Following the Great Depression and World War II, the Seminary could barely make ends meet, and the entire property was commandeered by the U.S. Army's Walter Reed Medical Hospital in 1942. The military demolished historic property and generally neglected the beautiful exotic and Victorian buildings. Gaining official historic status saved many of the buildings from demolition, but the neglect continued, allowing the elements and vandals to take their toll. In the 1980s, the ""Save Our Seminary"" group formed to protect what was left, and did an admirable job. The Army returned the historic Seminary properties to private hands and they were restored."

With a wide variety of po' boys on the menu as well as a delicious seafood gumbo — not to mention its name — it's safe to say that the cuisine here skews Cajun and Creole, an idea that was born of Davidson's nostalgia for his former home of New Orleans. But Roux is no one-trick pony: the menu includes local favorites like beef on weck, familiar Greek diner fare like chicken souvlaki served on a pita, and even the po' boy template is used for sandwich fillings that have little to do with Creole cuisine, like chicken Milanese. Most diverse of all are the homemade soups, four apiece that change daily and draw from chef Jamie Zynda's encyclopedic repertoire of delicious recipes. Breakfasts are among the heartiest downtown has to offer, and there's a gargantuan self-serve salad bar. As for ambience, Roux mixes corporate sterility with a few delightfully unique touches: for a taste of local history, there's a glass display case at the front entrance where every day they hang the front cover of the 100-years-old-to-the-day issue of the ''News'', and the dining room boasts unsurpassed views over both Canalside and the ''News'' building's fourth-floor atrium, ringed with a giant trough where tropical plants grow year-round."

The fact that the delay was due to the need for a complete top-to-bottom reconstruction of its building — one that many claimed was too far gone to be saved — is testament to the dogged perseverance and dedication of owners Paul and Sandra Wilkens, equally to the preservation of downtown's period buildings as to the provision of a topnotch dining experience to their customers. The specialty to which Raclettes owes its name is a Swiss French dish that one might describe as a cousin to fondue — you place a large block of cheese on a flat grill to slowly melt, then scrape it off onto a platter that includes buckwheat crêpes, potatoes and/or gherkins, and your choice of charcuterie meats. It's a dish that's available nowhere else in Buffalo, and the friendly staff is happy to walk newbies through the process, but a quick meal this is not — Raclette's advises you to allow at least an hour and a half for the whole experience. If you're pressed for time or otherwise not interested, the balance of the menu is made up of serviceable bistro fare — an interesting selection of Belgian-style ''moûles frites'', main-course salads, and ''coq au vin'' and other classic Gallic fare are dished out at dinner, the lunch menu boasts a range of croques and baguette sandwiches, the French onion soup and vegetable bouillabaisse (the latter one of the few items on the menu suitable for vegans) are spectacular, and there's an extensive and reasonably priced selection of wines available by the bottle or by the glass. All this goodness is served up in one of two environments: an oddly laid out but warm and comfortable dining room, with exposed brick walls full of old-school charm and comfortable, slightly offbeat furniture for an effect described by one reviewer as ""like dining in a wealthy friend's cozy library"", or else outdoors on the breezy sidewalk patio facing Roosevelt Plaza. If there's a complaint to be made about Raclette's, it's that the portions are more European-sized than American-sized (let alone Buffalo-sized), but the reasonable price point goes a long way to compensate."

The walls of the chapel are covered with murals illustrating Lanna customs, dress and scenes from daily life. The lovely Lai Kam chapel houses the revered Phra Singh Buddha image. Sadly, the head was stolen in 1922, and a reproduction is now seen. Your admission ticket is in a leaflet form containing useful information and map of Wat Phra Singh complex. The temple is most attractive during Songkran, the Thai New Year, in mid-April."

It was built in 1825 and then enlarged in 1894, when its floor plan was changed from to a pekov (the shape of a crucifix). On Broadway overlooking the bay, the church and its onion domes are a photographer's delight. The church contains almost 700 pieces of art, ranging from Russian Orthodox icons and books to the largest collection of 19th-century paintings in Alaska. The best time to view the church and its icons is at 18:00 on Saturday when staff members give an informal 30-minute tour just before service. Outside the church is a small graveyard, where the largest grave marker belongs to Baron Nicholas Zass. Born in 1825 in Archangel, Russia, he eventually became bishop of the Aleutian Islands and all of Alaska, before his death in 1882. Next door to the graveyard is the Bishop's House."

Gathered largely by founder William Wagner and Institute curators and faculty during the nineteenth century, the collections are displayed in cherry-wood and glass cabinets dating from the 1880s and maintain their original “systematic” scheme, providing a rare view of a Victorian science museum. Highlights include William Wagner’s personal mineral collection – one of the oldest in the country – and his fossil collection, representing many important European and American localities and collecting sites of the nineteenth century. The mounted skeletons, skulls and skins represent species from around the globe, including many that are now endangered. The extensive regional entomology collection is notable for its arrangement, which includes the original handwritten curator’s labels. Originally assembled to teach science, the specimens are arranged for study. The exhibit is one of the largest systematically arranged collections on display in the country and remains in active use as a key educational tool of the Institute’s free science programs. It also serves as a resource for scholarly research."

This was one of the bloodiest conflicts in recorded history &mdash; some estimates put the death toll higher than for World War I, and it was certainly much worse than the American Civil War at about the same time, even though the Chinese used more primitive weapons. It was a crucial moment in China's relationship with the West, modernity, and its relationship to its own imperial history. It was partly a religious movement; the leader claimed to be God's second son, Jesus' younger brother. The quasi-Christian, peasant-led rebellion overran an area greater than Texas with Nanjing as its capital. At different times it threatened both the foreign settlements in Shanghai and the Qing government in Beijing, though it did not take either. On exhibit are documents relating to Taiping history and the grinding reduction of their movement by enterprising Qing generals and their European auxiliaries, culminating in the siege of Nanjing. Next door are the beautiful Zhanyuan Gardens."

Unfortunately, Prince-Bishop Maximilian Friedrich, who had commissioned the building, never got to move in there, having died three years earlier. His successor didn't bother much, and shortly thereafter Münster lost its status of prince-bishopric and the palace was used for other purposes. These days it is home to the university administration. During World War 2, it was heavily damaged. The exterior was entirely rebuilt in the original style while the interior rather reflects the preferences of the 1950s. There's little to look at inside (although doors are open during university hours), but its façade is a curious and very characteristic combination of sandstone and red brick. During summer, lots of events are held on the square, somewhat marring the view more days than not."

Both Islamic and Christian relics, rugs, china. The views from the Fourth Court over the Bosphorus are spectacular. You can also see Prophet Mohammed's belongings. <br />'''BEWARE''' Any bus or tram with a sign or indication that it heads for or calls at Topkapı will '''NOT''' take you anywhere near Topkapı Palace. Rather, it is going to a neighbourhood named after the city gate near which it’s situated (""cannon gate""), which may be worth a trip to take a look at the impressive city walls. Topkapı neighbourhood is located in the extreme western part of the old city, near the city walls, while Topkapı Palace is located in the extreme eastern part, which means the distance between them is at least 7–8&nbsp;km. ‘Topkapı’ alone almost always refers to the neighbourhood, not the palace. Taking a bus heading for Topkapı to go to the palace is a common mistake made by travellers. For the palace, the stop/station you should look for is 'Sultanahmet'"

"Buffalo/West Side | eat | Rancho's | South American, Buffalo, Venezuelan, December 2015, Rascal, Niagara Street, Venezuelan, Joel Perez, Buffalo, Aragua State, Colombia, Venezuela, Rancho, all day, Venezuela, South American, Venezuelan, Rancho, Perez","One of a handful of new or soon-to-come South American eateries in Buffalo, Rancho's is a Venezuelan sandwich shop that opened in December 2015 at the former location of '''Rascal's''', on an up-and-coming stretch of Niagara Street. Venezuelan food is the name of the game here: owner Joel Perez is a recently arrived immigrant who came to Buffalo from his former home in Aragua State, and he's already turning heads among the West Side's increasingly numerous foodie community. The specialty here is ''arepas'', flatbread sandwiches that are a popular breakfast food in Colombia and Venezuela. Rancho's serves theirs not only at breakfast time but all day long; the naturally gluten-free corn flour in the bread is fried to a crisp and stuffed with your choice of rotisserie beef, shredded beef, chicken, or roast pork. Those who've travelled to Venezuela and experienced the cuisine on its home turf say they can't tell the difference. The menu doesn't stop there, though — hearty appetizers and side dishes include baked ''yuca'' drizzled in delicious avocado salsa, ''patacón pisao'' (shredded beef sliders with mashed fried plantain fritters as ""bread""), and ''tequeños'' (sort of a South American take on mozzarella sticks: fried ''queso blanco'' with garlic and herb salsa for dipping). As well, available on weekends only is what may be the greatest selection on the menu: ''sancocho'', a hearty chicken and beef soup thickened with potatoes and cassava, sweetened a little with corn on the cob, and seasoned with fresh cilantro; Venezuelan comfort food ''par excellence''. Rancho's prices are extremely reasonable, with nothing on the menu over $10, and Perez and his staff seem eager to convert curious first-time visitors into loyal repeat customers — this means expect super friendly and attentive service, and maybe a complimentary appetizer while you wait for your order."

Here, you can imbibe any of an impressive range of microbrews hailing from the local area and elsewhere, or perhaps a perfectly-executed specialty cocktail made with homemade mixers, while obscure British post-punk drones on the stereo — or just pick the brains of the crack bartending staff, whose encyclopedic knowledge of the products they stock and obvious passion for what they do are a big part of Ballyhoo's appeal. ""Less is more"" is the credo here, which describes the tastefully understated decor as well as the short but sweet menu that consists entirely of a maddeningly creative range of house-made sausages served in sandwich form (one reviewer cheekily declared ""finally, someplace that is giving the saying 'it was a real sausage fest' a positive connotation!"") Try the ""Curry Lamb Bam"" topped with the contrasting flavors of ''harissa'' and ''raita'' and served with ''tabbouleh'' on the side, the ""Church Chicken"" seasoned with Old Bay and dressed with whole-grain mustard and celery and apple slaw, and the ""Short Round"", ground Korean-style short rib flavored with ginger, garlic and scallions and topped with kimchee slaw and ''sambal'' aioli. A modest range of salads and soups are offered for sides, and ice cream sandwiches made with fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies make a delectable dessert. In summertime, the focus shifts outdoors to one of Buffalo's most interesting patios: a wooden deck facing Michigan Avenue constructed with salvaged materials supplied by '''Uncle Sam's Army/Navy Surplus''' in Larkinville (the planted boxes hanging from the rails are made from old missile casings!)"

You can walk to the ruins for free, but it's steep uphill and takes about an hour and a half. The toilets at the top cost 1 Sol to use!. You have to buy your ticket for entering the ruins at the Cultural Centre in Aguas Calientes (if you're not doing the whole tour from Cusco; tickets are available at the Peru Rail office there). This ticket costs S/. 152 per person (including entry to Huayna Picchu) and is valid for only one day, before was valid for 1 entry over a period of 3 days. Be aware that the office will not sell same-day tickets after 2:30PM and that the last entry into Machu Picchu is at 4PM, with visitors herded out by 5PM. Also note that the office will ask for your official passport when buying tickets rather than a photocopy, though agents may be flexible. Aguas Calientes is overpriced and nasty, so if you can stay in Ollantaytambo and get the first train at 06:10, it's way better. You'll arrive about 8am, still way before the large tour buses (10am - 2pm). Remember to take water and snacks with you as the snacks available at the ruins are insanely expensive. Even bring water with you to Aguas Calientes, as the shops there charge about double. Best to bring a packed lunch from Cusco, if possible."

The highest temperature yet recorded in any geothermal area in Yellowstone was measured in a scientific drill hole at Norris: 459°F (237°C) just 1,087 feet (326 meters) below the surface, and there are very few thermal features at Norris under the boiling point (199°F at this elevation). Norris shows evidence of having had thermal features for at least 115,000 years. The features in the basin change daily, with frequent disturbances from seismic activity and water fluctuations. Steamboat Geyser, the tallest geyser in the world (300 to 400 feet) and Echinus Geyser (pH 3.5 or so) are the most popular features. The basin consists of three areas: Porcelain Basin, Back Basin, and One Hundred Springs Plain. Porcelain Basin is barren of trees and provides a sensory experience in sound, color, and smell; a 3/4 mile dirt and boardwalk trail accesses this area. Back Basin is more heavily wooded with features scattered throughout the area; a 1.5 mile trail of boardwalk and dirt encircles this part of the basin. One Hundred Springs Plain is an off-trail section of the Norris Geyser Basin that is very acidic, hollow, and dangerous. Travel is discouraged without the guidance of knowledgeable staff members."

The Salty Dawg Saloon, Coal Point Seafoods, and  Land's End Resort are the among the few exceptions that are  open year round. The Spit is a  massive landspit jutting some four miles out into the middle of the bay. Although it is a naturally occurring formation, damage from the massive 1964 Good Friday earthquake made the harbor and other facilities inaccessible at high tide, and the Spit was partially rebuilt by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Spit is the center of all fishing related activity in Homer as well as a host of gift and specialty shops and eateries. Water taxis and ferries provide sea access to smaller settlements on the other side of the bay such as Seldovia and the artists colony of Halibut Cove. Marine and avian wildlife can be seen along the spit, including large numbers of bald eagles. Careful observers may also see sea otters, harbor seals, or even sea lions or whales. The ""fishing hole"" is a man made lagoon that is stocked with hatchery-bred salmon. These salmon leave the lagoon as they mature and live normal lives at sea, returning to the lagoon some years later due to the salmons natural instinct to return to the place it was born  in order to spawn and die itself. This is one of the most accessible saltwater salmon fishing locations in all of Alaska, and includes a  wheelchair ramp. A walk from the start to the end of the spit will take around an hour. A walk along the beach is a beautiful way to see the spit but be careful of the tide as the beach isn't always accessible at high tide. Kachemak Bay experiences tidal variances of up to thirty feet in a day, so always be aware on any beach in the area that you may need to head to higher ground to get back the way you came."

Black Squirrel is one of a very few producers of rum in New York State, and the only one in the country that uses maple syrup as the main ingredient rather than cane sugar — a peculiarity that was borne of the requirement that New York-based craft distillers source 75% of their ingredients from within the state, though no sugarcane is grown that far north. The end result grafts a subtle yet distinctive maple finish onto the flavor of what is otherwise a rather traditional amber rum. All the rums produced by Black Squirrel are handcrafted in small batches with meticulous attention to detail; distilled in a traditional copper-columned pot still then aged in oak barrels, the old-fashioned way. In the same vein, Black Squirrel also produces an unaged, 90-proof distilled spirit they call ""mapleshine"" — essentially what backwoods distillers would call ""sugar shine"", except with maple syrup in place of sugar. The small retail shop/tasting room is set up in the style of a speakeasy, an homage to Schwinger's great-grandparents who ran one on this very corner during Prohibition."

He wanted to use it after he stepped down as a monarch, but died before it was completed. When King Rama V took over, he gave the palace to his younger brothers, and turned the park into a zoo. When he built the Dusit Palace in the early 20th century, he moved all the animals to the Dusit Zoo. The park then became a property of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before being turned into a public park in 1960. The basic layout still resembles its design by King Rama IV. It is a lush garden created around a lake, home to glasshouses, ancient trees and wooden pagodas. A great place to relax and escape the heat. After work, many locals run around the paths for exercise or do aerobics on (very) loud music. There's also a table tennis table and always someone who wants to play. At the south end of the park is a marble monument dedicated to HM Queen Sunantha Kumareerat and HRH Prince Kannaporn Phetcharat, who died in a boating accident during the reign of King Rama V."

The only remaining relic of the medieval church is its belfry, from c. 1300, which on fine days in summertime gives a view of four counties from the tower’s height. The original church is said to have fallen into ruin sometime in the seventeenth century. The new church of early Gothic style was built in 1811 on the foundations of the old St. Columba's Round Tower. The Sexton’s Lodge is also of architectural interest and was built in 1870. The body of Brian Boru was said to have been brought there in 1014 to be waked after the Battle of Clontarf, while on the way to be buried in Armagh.

Cold War era tourist attractions on Taiwan-controlled Kinmen off the coast include guns built for shelling Xiamen and bunkers built to protect against shells from Xiamen.  : The Hulishan Fortress was built in 1894 as part of China's Westernization Movement. The architecture is in a Qing Dynasty style. On the front of the platform there are “Wanggui platform” and “Pangui platform”, from which you can see the Dadan and Xiaodan islands through a telescope. In the yard of the cannon platform there is a gorgeous wall sculpture named “the Soul of the Nation” and a water fountain."

As indicated by the architectural remains of the scene, the initial construction phase followed the invasion by the Persians and the reconstruction of the city in the fifth century BC. A striking fact is the construction of the cavea (gr.: koilo, auditorium) on an artificial hill surrounded by numerous retaining walls, instead of taking advantage of the citadel's slopes. During the first building phase, the scene looked like a palace, disposed of five adjacent rectangle rooms and found itself at the same level as the circular orchestra, leading to it via three entrances. At its peak (fourth century BC), the theatre suffered transformations and was shaped to a large extent in its present form. Local poros stone was used for the foundation and limestone for the parodoi (passageways), which sloped to the orchestra in order to diminish the difference in height with the cavea. The theatre seated 6,300 spectators and is reminiscent in form to the Theatre of Dionysos in Athens, after transformation of the latter in 330 BC. Following the destruction of Eretria by the Romans in 198 BC, it was rebuilt with lower quality materials and the rooms to the south of the parodos were then apparently decorated with colour mortars of the first Pompeian style. Unfortunately, most benches have been looted. There are still the impressive remains of the scene, especially the vaulted underground passage leading to the orchestra centre. Excavation of the monument was undertaken by the American Archaeological School, while the local Ephorate of Antiquities strived greatly for its restoration."

Perhaps the best description of dinner at R&L was given by the reviewer who compared it to ""sitting around the kitchen table with relatives"", and grandmotherly barkeep Lottie is nothing if not fully engaged with her customers — the philosophy she expounded on in a May 2010 writeup in the ''Buffalo News'' (""A bartender is like a psychiatrist... a lot of bars don't make it because they're not trained to be people's people; they're only trained to pour drinks"") means that she's liable to come over to your table and talk your ear off, dishing on the latest neighborhood gossip or showing off old family photos. The ambience — original tin ceiling, homey wood-paneled walls where old Genesee Beer ads share space with tacked-up pictures of the Virgin Mary — completes the old-school picture. As for the food, R&L's menu is limited in size but impeccable in quality: Lottie's take on ''gołąbki'' is light as air and delicious, and her handmade pierogi are elegant in their simplicity, standing up well on their own merits without any of the traditional accompaniments like sautéed onions and sour cream. Most popular of all, though, are the Friday fish fries — it's standing room only during Lent as folks from all over Western New York stream back into the old neighborhood to feast on these delicately tasty haddock filets, and R&L stays open well into the evening to accommodate them. Keep in mind that this is a small, family-run operation, so the place sometimes closes without notice and can run out of food on a particularly busy day. It's always best to call ahead."

An oval shaped patch of green in the overdeveloped Dōgo neighborhood, ''Dōgo Kōen'' is an important part of Matsuyama's identity because it harbors the ruins of Yuzuki Castle. '''Yuzuki-jō''' was the residence of the '''Kōno Clan''' (河野), who ruled Iyo Province (伊予, now Ehime) from the 13th to the late 16th century, when war lord '''Toyotomi Hideyoshi''' (豊臣秀吉) sent an army to Shikoku to conquer and unify Japan. The excavation of the 30,000 square meter site took over 14 years, but the castle, gardens, and residences were all recovered.

Arabic show LE 11, private shows in foreign languages, LE 65 + LE 300 (covers operating expenses), Arabic private show, LE 16.50 + LE 150. More than slightly kitsch and frequently inaccurate in historical detail, but a worthwhile evening activity nonetheless. The ""voice of the Sphinx"" narrates the history of the Giza Plateau and its place in Egyptian history, as a dazzling laser display picks out the details of the Pyramids and displays historical scenes on the side of the Great Pyramid itself. If you eat at the Pizza Hut restaurant just outside the entrance to the Sound and Light Show, there's a good chance you'll be offered to watch the show from the roof of the restaurant for a small tip. While it's not as good as watching it from a front row seat inside the fences, it's excellent value for money. As of November 2009, extremely bright lights have been pointed at the roof of the Pizza Hut and various other buildings to get tourists to attend the show. They put projection lights towards the Pizza Hut so it's not easy to see much. Pizza Hut has replied by putting up a barricade on the roof to try to block the light."

They really did a spectacular job remodeling the place, installing a bar whose top is made from wood salvaged from wharf piers that were excavated during the construction of '''Canalside''' and hanging works by local artists on the wall for a finished product that's cozy yet airy, classy yet unmistakably pub-like. What's served at the Public House of Buffalo is, first and foremost, a huge selection of beer, available on draft as well as in cans and bottles — microbrews dominate some 80 entries on the beer list, including locally-produced craft beers from '''Flying Bison''' and the '''Resurgence Brewery'''. If you're overwhelmed by all the choices, never fear: the bartenders are helpful and knowledgeable about their stock, and will be more than happy to point you in the right direction. As for the food, they describe it as ""elevated pub fare"" — classic bar food kicked up a notch with creative gourmet twists. For example, chicken fingers come milanese style and are served with a side of pesto aioli — and what would a Western New York bar be without chicken wings, tossed in barbeque or classic Buffalo sauce as well as options like Sriracha sesame sauce or '''Chiavetta's''' marinade. Owner Frank's roots as a Chautauqua County farm boy come out in his emphasis on locally-sourced farm-to-table produce, so if you're in the mood for a salad, expect to see seasonal ingredients and enjoy farm-fresh flavors."

Country music was originally classed as ""Hillbilly Records"", which were mass-produced starting in the 1920s, when there was a huge immigration of poor Southern white farmers to the major cities of the South, North and, later, West, in parallel to the Great Migration of Southern African-Americans to the North. The homesick white former farmers bought these records in droves, just as the black former sharecroppers supported the companies that pressed the blues and other so-called ""Race Records"" during the same period. Nashville also has an industrial heritage dating back to the 19th century, starting with the arrival of railways in 1859 and continuing with the electrification of the local trolley system in 1889 and the beginning of production at Marathon Motor Car in 1910."

Because of the Nazi invasion of Soviet Union at the beginning of World War II, the building was never used for the intended purpose; it was fortified in 1941, and used as a local command post for the Soviet Red Army during the Siege of Leningrad. Some small bunkers, built from reinforced concrete, still stand at several corners. Later, the building housed the Soviet research institute, which focused on the design of electronic components for military objects. Currently, the office space in the building is rented out to various businesses. The square in front is called Moscow Square (Moskovskaya Ploshad). The square was remodelled and upgraded with a massive monument to Vladimir Lenin designed by Mikhail Anikushin, during the construction of the subway station Moskovskaya in 1970.

Because the Cavalry only expected to be here a short while, they built a temporary post near the base of the Terraces called Camp Sheridan. After five cold, harsh winters, they realized that their stay in the park was going to be longer than expected, so they built Fort Yellowstone, a permanent post. In 1891, the first building to be constructed was the guard house because it directly coincided with the Cavalry's mission - protection and management. By 1916, the National Park Service was established, and the Cavalry gave control of Yellowstone back to the civilians. Since that time, historic Fort Yellowstone has been Yellowstone's headquarters."

The main function of the building is television broadcasting, but the shiny sphere atop the tower houses a viewing platform, a restaurant and a Berlin Tourist Information point. The viewing platform sits 203 metres above ground, affording views of as much as 42&nbsp;km away and featuring a bar. The ''Sphere'' restaurant at 207 metres rotates at a speed of one full spin per 30 minutes. There are two lifts from the base to the platform and cafe, taking 40 seconds to reach the top, as well as a 986-step staircase. The ''Fernsehturm'' is not accessible to wheelchair users.<br>Not all of the Berliners liked the tower and the overall composition of the Alexanderplatz afforded by the socialist city planners, and they nicknamed the building ""Telespargel"" (""television asparagus""). During certain times of day, sunlight reflecting from the top caused a large cross-shaped light to shine down on the city. Called the ''Rache des Papstes'' (Pope's revenge) by nominally atheist East Berliners, the light-cross was an ironic result of socialist architecture. Rumour has it the architect was deprived of more than his next commission after that fiasco. At night, the Fernsehturm sometimes appears to be shooting light beams from the tower section, giving the impression it's a Death Star à la Star Wars."

Former UB student Eddie Liang opened Eddie's Chophouse in his old stomping grounds near the South Campus because he felt the time was ripe for Buffalonians to sample a new permutation of Chinese food, and what better spot for the big launch than in the thick of the vibrant Asian and Asian-American community gathered around the university? Eddie's is the first restaurant in Buffalo to serve ''siu mei'', or Chinese barbecue — a Cantonese culinary tradition where meat is coated in a seasoning sauce and then slowly rotisseried, bone-in, in a Chinese smoker — and your choices here are pork, duck, chicken, or spare ribs, served either over steamed white rice or as a soup with your choice of macaroni or rice or egg noodles. (If you opt for soup, further ingredients become available: steamed wontons, fish balls, and beef tripe.) A limited range of other selections are also offered, along with a wide selection of hot and cold teas to drink as well as iced mint lemonade, which might be the most popular item Eddie's serves. The pint-sized menu and spartan (if pleasant) interior are made up for by quality and value — the meat served here is fresh and bursting with flavor and comes in huge portions that make the low prices charged that much more spectacular.

The Hindu Cham people started construction on the two 20-metre (65 ft) towers in the 11th century after establishing Vijaya as the capital of their empire and the port city of Quy Nhơn as its economic engine. Originally three towers were planned, but for unknown reasons, only two exist, and the site became known to the Vietnamese as Tháp Đôi (""The Twin Towers""). Unusually for Cham architecture, the Twin Towers eschew the traditional multi-storey square construction in favour of a large rectangular base topped by a carved pyramid structure. The towers were built from brick in the typical Cham style in which pieces were tiled closely together and then baked into a solid block, with the unusual addition of crushed stone for support. The outer structure and external sculptures were made from sandstone. The art and architecture share many characteristics with Angkor sites in present-day Cambodia thanks to the frequent exchange&mdash;in both peace and war&mdash;between Champa and the Khmer kingdom. This later Cham period is particularly characterized by the intricate and ornate animal statues and carvings which the Cham adopted after moving their capital to Bình Định. The holy bird Garuda rests on top of the vegetation-covered roofs, protecting the towers from evil forces, while below are detailed carvings of giant lotus bases, elephants, lions, monkeys and humans dancing. The towers were restored in the 1980s and 1990s with help from a Polish archaeological team, and the area around them has been developed into a small park, with trees and grass surrounding the archaeological site and shielding it from the traffic outside (ironically, one of the only noisy stretches of road anywhere in the city is Trần Hưng Đạo street directly in front of the towers). The neighbourhood just to the north of the towers is a pleasant and quiet residential area on the banks of the river, with a few local cafes and restaurants."

It is considered one of the four great towers in China. The tower sits atop Snake Hill near the Number One Yangtze River Bridge and affords a commanding view of the Yangtze River as well as the mouth of the Han River where it connects. The view of the city is very impressive, although at times made slightly hazy by smog. On the clearest days, one can see practically the entire city of Wuhan and far up and down the Yangtze River.<p>Entering the park costs ¥80 (as of 12/2010) which gives access to Snake Hill Park, Yellow Crane Tower and the Mao Pavilion (in which many of the poems of Chairman Mao are etched into stone for viewing pleasure). The park as a whole is nicely landscaped with many charming buildings. Of particular interest is the enormous bronze bell located behind Yellow Crane Tower itself as well as a teahouse on the premises which features regular performances of traditional Chu-era music. The performance itself is free, but it is expected that patrons enjoying it order at least a beverage or a small snack.<p>The current tower was completed in the 1980s using modern materials, most notably, concrete is used instead of wood for all supporting members so as to prevent yet another disaster, since the twelve previous towers were all destroyed by fires and war. The ground floor of the tower contains a large entrance hall, two stories tall, with enormous decorative lamps and a giant ceramic fresco displaying the quasi-mythical story of the tower's initial construction. The second story, essentially a balcony around the entrance hall, contains a souvenir shop as well as displays of traditional Chinese paintings and calligraphy. The third story has a residence done up in the very ancient, Chu style modelled after the kinds of sitting rooms used by nobility greeting guests in the ancient period. The fourth story contains another souvenir shop and a set of models displaying the tower in five of its previous incarnations. This latter display shows the fascinating development of an essentially military watchtower into an increasingly residence/tourist-oriented showpiece. The top accessible story has pay telescopes and some nice art displays.<p>Yellow Crane Tower (and, in fact, Snake Hill Park in general) is wheelchair-accessible in most areas of interest. The tower even has two elevators suited to the elderly and the handicapped who would otherwise not be able to climb the stairs to the top. Ramps abound in most of the areas of interest."

At the time of its construction in 1932, there were no buildings around its current site, and with the exception of the Jozef van Hovestraat, all streets were unpaved roads. By 1932 however, the crossing became increasingly important because of the expansion of the Laag Kraainem residential area, and the construction of the Salesian Monastery along the Kapellelaan 1 km further between 1928 and 1930. As more streets were added in later years, a roundabout was constructed to divert traffic away from the immediate surroundings of the chapel and preserve the original roads. The chapel is one of the most iconic landmarks of Kraainem, and known by local children because of the adjacent kindergarten and primary school.

During the 16th and 17th Centuries, Russians reconstructed the Kremlin with new fortifications and Russian institutions (such as the Annunciation Cathedral). Many of the features of the Kremlin reflect Russian influence of that era, and the construction of the parapets and watchtowers is particularly reminiscent of other dominant Russian cities of the time, such as Pskov and Novgorod. The Kremlin has been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. Entry to the Kremlin is through the white clock tower (the Spasskaya Tower) at the end of Bauman Street. Entry costs 300 Rubles with a guided tour, or 20 Rubles to explore the grounds on one's own. There are several interesting things to see inside the Kremlin, including:"

This utterly bizarre park of massive sculptures (some over 20 m tall) is the handiwork of the mystic, Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat, who bought the land in 1978 when he was kicked out of his native Laos. A similar park of his earlier work remains near Vientiane. Synthesizing Buddhism and Hindu ideologies, Buddhas, many-armed goddesses, naga snakes and all sorts of human-animal hybrids dominate the scenery.   :There is no direct public transport.

You can also arrange a return journey by tuk-tuk (around 100 baht including the cost of the driver waiting one hour) or hire a motorbike at Limmanee Motor in Nong Khai.

You enter via a womb-shaped tunnel and walk the circle past statues depicting the stages of life.   :Luang Pu's mummified remains are enshrined on the third floor of the '''Sala Kaew Khu''' pavilion itself.  :The park is particularly imposing during the peak of the rainy season in August, when the sunlight is soft and changeable, vegetation is verdant and acacia trees are in full bloom with yellow fragrant flowers.  :The top of the tallest structure of Sulilat's earlier park on the Lao side of Mekong (known as Buddha Park) can be seen jutting above the trees if you walk along the Mekong past ''Wat That'' and look carefully over the Lao side of the river."

The story itself is quite greasy, but very romantic. You can find signs hinting to the trumpeter (and to the Kater Hidigeigei, which is a early ancestor of Garfield, another figure from one of Scheffel's books) all over town, the main one being the Trumpeter's palace, conveniently located in the so-called Schlosspark (Palace Park).

The place was then called Dihi Kolkata. The British decided to settle there, because it was less crowded than other areas in the neighbourhood. They built the old Fort William here (at the place where the General Post Office now stannds.). After their victory in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, they built the new fort in Gobindapur, Dalhousie Square remained at the heart of what was then the 'White Town' of Kolkata. No Indian, rich or poor, dared to live in the area. They came for work during day time and went back to 'Black Town' (Sutanuti) before sunset. With Writers Building occupying the north side and numerous commercial offices all around it became the administrative and business centre of Kolkata. Even now it stands out as a 'period piece'. After independence of India, the square was named after three youngsters who dared to challenge British rule and died there in 1930."

The Congshen Temple behind the Three Pagodas has recently been rebuilt and reopened, after deteriorating in the 20th century due to earthquakes, fires and the Cultural Revolution.

The warder may have occupied the quarters to the left of the gate, while to the right was the janitor's room with the priest's room overhead. The adjoining chapel, built in the late thirteenth century, was probably used as the Archbishop's private oratory. Other buildings, recorded in an inquisition in 1326, have now vanished, including the great hall on the east side of the enclosure. The Archbishop abandoned Swords once a new palace was built at Tallaght in 1324 - a move no doubt encouraged by damage sustained during Bruce's campaign of 1317. The stepped battlements suggest some form of occupancy during the fifteenth century, but by 1583, when briefly occupied by Dutch Protestants, it was described as ""the quite spoiled old castle"". It was used as a garden in the nineteenth century and sold after the Church of Ireland was disestablished. Swords Castle is undergoing a significant redevelopment and is intended to become a major tourist attraction. The newly renovated castle was used as a film location for the production of TV series The Tudors in spring 2010. Due to the ongoing restoration work, the interior of the castle is only open for groups by appointment only by calling the number above."

The soothing waters of the hotel's hot springs lured many famous Europeans, including the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Antigua-based Vice Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson and Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence, the future William IV of the United Kingdom. These luminaries attended balls and private parties at the hotel. The hotel's time of splendiferous entertainment and revelry collapsed with the sugar industry in the 19th century, and the original structure suffered damage in a 1950 earthquake. However, in recent years the building has been repaired and restored, and now serves as government offices. Open-air access to the volcanic hot-spring water is available to anyone without charge, and in 2013 a channel was built to allow people to access pools of the volcanic water when it is less than extremely hot, as it is when it first emerges from the spring."

Though casual passersby along the main drag might miss this place — it's tucked away behind '''Daisy's Doghouse''', with an entrance facing Norwalk Avenue — this charming European-style wine boutique is worth seeking out for the expansive selection of vintages on offer. Though the selection here spans every variety and geographic region imaginable, Savory Sips' is far from a kitchen-sink approach: all the wines Christie stocks on the shelves are individually selected, organic, small-batch vintages priced under $27 per bottle (more expensive wines, including some very hard-to-find selections, are available by special order on request). Matching the wide-ranging selection is Christie's encyclopedic knowledge of the products she stocks and of the wine industry in general, and she puts that knowledge to full use for her customers whether it be helping with a pairing or just talking shop with fellow wine lovers who stop in. The interior of the store is Christie's handiwork as well: with walls painted in rich, warm earth tones and a hand-built wine bar in the back, the space looks like Tuscany by way of Mexico. About the only weakness Savory Sips has is a disappointing selection of local wines, but do ask the owner about the group wine-tasting excursions to the Finger Lakes, the Niagara Peninsula, and other nearby winemaking regions that she offers through her side business, '''Village Wine Tours'''. Free public wine tastings are also held once a month; see the website for details."

Outside of Japan, Okinawa is often viewed as the first battle on Japanese soil however, like the other Pacific Islands, Okinawa was also colonized territory so the local population was not fully trusted by the Japanese and often treated as expendable. With the Americans being obvious enemies and the Japanese not being complete allies, the question on many Okinawans' minds was not ""How am I going to survive?"" but ""How do I want to die?"". The museums here show the war from a uniquely Okinawan perspective, including life for citizens, students and military. It also depicts well how they were mistreated by both the Japanese and the Americans during and after the war.

In a real blow to the Chicago blues, it closed in 2003. In search of a new home, Checkerboard moved to Hyde Park — a move quite controversial, in that had moved into the most well-to-do neighborhood in the area. Indeed, the Checkerboard is no longer the tiny, smoke-filled juke joint that played host to blues legends like Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, as well as some blues worshipers like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. Don't worry, though, it might be impossible to fill those giant shoes, but it's still a great blues club, and you'll get a real taste of blues on the South Side."

Only a small portion of the city has been unearthed, including a theatre, two water fountains, a courthouse, baths, the bishop's palace and two basilicas (but, save for the theatre, you'll need a lot of imagination to visualize how these buildings looked like in their heyday, as all that is left are their foundations). What actually worth seeing on the site are the '''mosaics''' of the big basilica, made in the 5th century. The floor mosaic in the narthex is the most complete presentation of the world as they understood it back then. In the centre of a rectangular field there is a fountain out of which a grapevine comes (as a symbol of Christ's teachings) and peacocks and deer are gathered around (as symbol of eternal life), meaning if you accept the teaching of Christ you’ll have eternal life. On the left and on the right there are 5 trees rich with fruits with birds flying around (representing the garden of Eden and the afterlife), and a huge red dog called Kerber (Cerberus) is guarding the entrance. Below the trees, animals like deer are presented attacked and eaten by wild animals (presenting the suffering of the Christian soul in the earth life). The field is surrounded by water with medallions in which 28 water animals are presented. The mosaic has been made with little stones in 27 different colours (the only “richer” mosaic is found in Pompeii - a wall mosaic made of stones in 32 colours). There is a small '''museum''' (no extra fee) on the grounds with very few artifacts (more or less limited to a couple of ancient stone masks) and a nice scale model of the city at its peak. If you are already in Bitola, Heraclea is probably worth a visit, but if you have already been to much better known sites of antiquity around the Mediterranean basin, keep in mind that this place leaves much to be desired—but, hey, where else has such a romantic name? - A leisurely stroll around the ruins will take 45–50 minutes at most. Most of the site is inaccessible for wheelchair users."

The Tower is accessible by boats both from Salacak (very frequent intervals four seasons) or from Kabataş in European Side, on the Bosphorus waterfront at the end of the funicular line from Taksim Square (about once every two hours, summers only). Story has it that a powerful emperor built the tower in the middle of the sea to protect his beloved daughter from death after hearing a prophecy told by a fortuneteller, but a snake had found its way to the tower (inside a basket of fruits) and, as you have already guessed, had bitten and killed the princess, although in reality it is far more likely that the place was built as a lighthouse to warn the ships entering the Bosphorus about the rocky islet the tower was built on. There is also a viewing area on the coast directly opposite the Tower where you can buy tea and sit down to enjoy the beauty of Bosphorus while listening to traditional Turkish music&mdash;much cheaper than the Tower itself. It is recommended to visit right at sunset, when the sun is reflecting off the water and the Tower's lights are turning on. Also at the viewing area, there are 2-person gondola rides."

A lot of the products are bought in Japan and resold in Korea by dealers.

The market has a reputation for fleecing foreigners, particularly due to its proximity to the Yongsan U.S. Army Base. Be wary as Koreans try to avoid Yongsan for their electronics needs and rely instead on Internet shopping as sellers in Yongsan are not averse to ripping you off if you don't seem to know a lot about electronics. If you go, it's best to bring a Korean guide so you can ensure you're getting a good deal. The problem is no or very poor English. Only Korean warranty. Cash preferred.

Henry Trigg had his coffin placed in the rafters of 37 High St to avoid body snatchers. After his death in 1724 his brother, The Rev Thomas Trigg, put aside any scruples that he may have had and agreed to fulfil Henry's request. The remains were duly sealed in a coffin and placed in full view in the appointed location. In 1774 the house became the Old Castle Inn. In 1831, a new landlord Mr Bellamy, took over. His first task was to inspect the coffin. Henry, he confirmed, was still inside. A further check was made in 1906 when members of the East Hertfordshire Archaeological Society were allowed access to it. Their report shows that the coffin contained about two thirds of a human skeleton. However, during the first world war soldiers were stationed in the area. Several were reported to have plundered the coffin taking home bones as souvenirs. It was also reported that some soldiers sold on some bones to the local populous as trinkets. It would appear therefore that, despite all his precautions, poor old Henry finally fell foul of his dreaded bodysnatchers. The coffin still remains in situ in the rafters of a building now owned by the National Westminster bank, at 37 High Street, Old Stevenage. There is a plaque recording the event on the building."

However, Hortobágy is much older, with alkalinization estimated to have started ten thousand years ago, when the Tisza first found its way through the Great Hungarian Plain, cutting off many streams from their sources in the Northern Mountains. The formation was finished by grazing animals, mastodons, and wild horses during the Ice Age, followed by domesticated animals. - One of its most iconic sites is the Nine-holed Bridge.

For two years, 50.000 seedlings of ornamental trees and shrubs, from among which many species difficult to adapt to our climate were planted. Thus, the park began to take shape: the lake and the two islands, the river, bridges, small waterfalls, alleys, ""The Suspended Bridge"", with itstwo gorgeous porticos, ""The Enchanted Castle"", ""The Circular Hall"", the deers`pen and the bears`cave, the pier and the restaurant on the bank of the lake, pavilions, greenhouses, imitations of rocks and tree trunks made of armoured-concrete etc. The park`s inauguration took place in May 1903, and the celebrations caused by the event lasted for two weeks. Conceived and created like a romantic park with a surface of 90 hectares, plus the lakes(4 hectares) and the racecourse(20 hectares), the park is unique in Romania, in its own way. Moreover, this is the second largest park of its kind in Europe, and the racecourse is the biggest in the Balkan area. In 1956, it was enclosed with a fence, the monumental portal at the main entrance being built at the same time."

Matches between the two sides are always very charged affairs which attract sell-out crowds. Crowd violence is rare though, as there is always a strong police presence at big matches to keep things in order."

Pastor Herman Alston is the one who carries on the church's long tradition: founded in 1921, it bounced around various locations around the area (including most notably a spell in the 1970s, '80s and '90s at the historic '''Michigan Street Baptist Church''') before landing in the old '''Masten Park Baptist Church''' on East North Street in the Fruit Belt: a simple yet striking English Gothic building erected in 1932 using local limestone."

In its cultural programme it carries on the debate of 1958: What kind of future do we want for tomorrow? Our happiness depends on what? Its recent renovation in 2006 gave its original brightness back, and the new equipments guarantee its durability. Five of the nine spheres are open to the public (so they say, but not really true). One of them is housing a permanent exhibition dedicated to Expo 58 (just some small models of some countries pavilions). Another sphere is dedicated to temporary exhibitions with scientific themes (often closed when there is no exhibition). The upper sphere offers spectacular views of the city of Brussels. When the sky is clear, the view reaches till Antwerp. There is a ""kids zone"" sphere which staff will happily direct you to even though you can never go in, it is only open to touring schoolchildren, and there is nothing inside except places for kids to sleep. In truth there are only three spheres: the top (restaurant), middle (snack bar) and bottom; the only thing to see really is the view; rather expensive at €11. The restaurant, also situated at the top, is open every day till 11PM At night, the nine spheres are lit up with 2,970 lights that offer a very special show. To enrich your visit: audioguides in EN (but also in F, NL, ES, IT and RU) are available at the cash desk for €2. Visio-guides are also available (€2) for the deaf and hard of hearing people. In August 2010, a zip-line was available from the top of the tallest sphere (102m); the ""Death Ride"" (run by former members of the Belgian Special Services) is a separate €25, and offers a rather unique view of the insides of the Atomium and the surrounding city."

In 1984 Shekou was booming and there was a serious shortage of accommodation. To deal with this, the cruise ship ""Ming Hua"" (originally commissioned in 1962 in France) was moored alongside the dock and used as a floating hotel. Only nine years before it had been the focus of a political typhoon during the movement which saw Deng Xiaoping sent for the second time into political limbo. No wonder that he was happy to write an inscription in his own handwriting, ""Sea World"", a facsimile of which now presides in neon over the ship.

Their list included Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Arnold Zweig, Kurt Tucholsky and Sigmund Freud. Today a monument is the reminder, though it blames Nazi students for the episode. When entering the square it's easy to miss the monument. Look dead centre: the monument is underground. A piece of plexiglass allows the viewer to look underground into a large, white room, filled with entirely empty, blank white bookcases. The absence of books reminds the viewer just what was lost here: ideas. But the event did reveal things to come, as ethnically Jewish author and philosopher Heinrich Heine, whose books were burned, let one of his characters say in an 1821 play: ""This was only the foreplay. Where they burn books, they will also burn people."" He was correct."

The park is located near the River Dee and with views across the river to the meadows and Queen’s Park and out towards the south of Chester.  :Grosvenor Park was one of the first public parks in Britain outside of the big industrial cities and was given to the city of Chester in 1867 by Richard Grosvenor, the Second Marquess of Westminster."

That all changed with the opening of Sagarmatha Grocery, whose owner Kaji Sunwar is a Nepalese expat who, with a little help from Buffalo's '''Rich Products Corporation''' and Canisius College's '''Students In Free Enterprise''', cut the ribbon to this friendly little shop in 2012. Here can be found a full range of fresh produce, canned and packaged goods, and spices to serve the palettes of Buffalo's Nepalese and Bhutanese immigrant communities, as well as other aficionados of those cuisines. As well, fresh goat, chicken, fish and beef are sold Wed-Sun, and a small selection of brightly-colored ethnic clothing items is also stocked. Sagarmatha doesn't neglect the rest of the multicultural West Side tapestry, either, stocking groceries and sundry items of interest to the Burmese, African, and Latino contingents as well, including an impressive range of Goya products for the latter."

Kanbo, Ochiai","For those looking for a little less effort but a rewarding mountain experience (and who have a car), Ochi-hage (1683m) is only a 30-40 minute hike from Ochiai-toge (Ochiai mountain pass) and visible from the road here (take the path going to the left on the pass top if heading up from Ochiai, the opposite direction of the Mt. Yahazu trail). The beginning of the path is a gentle climb through the sasa-grass with lots of views, and the final 10-15 minute climb is a bit steeper but not too strenuous. The valley view is grand here, with Miune and Tenguzuka directly across the valley here, Tsurugi-san far off to the left, and the peaks of Nishi-Iya to the right. On a clear day, the Seto Sea and Takamatsu can be seen to the north. A further 4km hike (2 to 2.5hours) past Ochi-hage leads to '''Mt. Kanbo''' (also spelled ""Kanpou"", 寒峰 1604m). If looking west, it's the higher sasa-grass covered peak to the left, and from there paths also go down to the village of Kurisuto (between Ochiai and Kyojo).

Here you'll find the usual lineup of Westernized Thai dishes that Stateside fans of the genre are familiar with — ''pad thai''; red, green and ''penang'' curries; ''pad kee mow'' and ''tom yum'' soup for those who like it spicy (unlike many Thai places, Yummy Thai doesn't blandify the food for the American palate; when they say ""spicy"", they mean it!); chicken and beef satay as appetizers. Portions are ample, but the quality of the food is as middle-of-the-road as the selection. If you're in the mood for something a bit more offbeat, though, you're not completely out of luck at Yummy Thai, especially if you peruse the house-special stir fry mains. These aren't the most authentic things in the world, but they make up for it with creativity: the ""Peanut King"" features mushroom, bell peppers, baby corn, broccoli, and napa cabbage in a light peanut sauce, and in the ""Healthy Garlic"" the same vegetables are combined with fresh garlic and served in Yummy Thai's special garlic sauce; these along with most entrees are served with your choice of meat, seafood, or tofu for vegetarians. If you're in town on a busy Friday or Saturday night and don't feel like arriving at a restaurant for dinner only to wait an eternity for a table, the perennially uncrowded Yummy Thai may be the place for you, but don't expect that to necessarily translate into fast or attentive service, which is a weak spot here."

San Rafael was a hospital mission, tending the sick from Spanish settlements and natives. The first mission secularized, it was used by General John C. Fremont during the Mexican-American War, and during statehood as the Marin County Courthouse. The original church was torn down in 1861, and a series of Catholic churches were erected at that site. The mission chapel was restored in 1949, and tours of the site as well as a museum containing three original mission bells are open to the public."

Apart from major chains it has a few cool unique stores like Artwork's that showcase high end furniture and home décor. It is very busy on a weekday lunch. This place is perfect for the urbanite who wants to shop at the brands, rather than the unique shops elsewhere downtown. It can be hard for someone unfamiliar to get in and out of as some northside entrances use hallways to get into the mall.

Here at The Big Easy, with the help of his fiancée-cum-head chef Lisa, he pays tribute to his newfound culinary obsession, and does so with aplomb: this place may not be able to compare with '''Shango''' or '''Toutant''' when it comes to upscale ambience, but in terms of authenticity it blows both of them out of the water. The Big Easy's menu offers a degree of variety without being overwhelming in length, and the ""deep-fried Southern mainstays"" (to borrow the words of one reviewer) you can order at the counter are dominated by a selection of po' boy sandwiches, which come in 6-inch or foot-long sizes and are filled with generous portions of meat and fixin's: shrimp, fried catfish, and Cajun chicken are the most popular selections, though you can also get a roast beef or hot smoked sausage sandwich. Seasoned fries come on the side in all cases. Elsewhere on the menu is easily Buffalo's most authentic take on the muffuletta sandwich; a distinctly Louisianian take on that Buffalo specialty, the fish fry (Southern-fried catfish takes the place of breaded haddock); and out-of-this-world bread pudding for dessert — but The Big Easy's customers reserve their highest praise for the seafood mac & cheese that's available as a side order (though the portions are so gargantuan it'd probably serve just as well as a main course); a perfectly cooked, creamy and saucy ambrosia with almost as much shrimp and crawfish as pasta. The Big Easy mostly does takeout business, but there's also a small, immaculately clean dining room with a few spartan yet comfy tables and chairs. Service here is enthusiastically helpful and friendly — these folks really go above and beyond in showing customers they appreciate their patronage."

It is one of the ten ""Best Preserved Ancient City from Ming Dynasty"". The ancient city is right beside Xingcheng Railway Station, and it is very convenient for visitors to spend half day in. The entrance for the ancient city itself is free, while one needs to pay if he wants to enter some temples or walk onto the city wall. In 1626, Ming General Yuan ChongHuan 袁崇焕 used the cannons imported from Portugal (红夷大炮 = ""Western Cannons"") to seriously injure Nurhachi at the East Gate of Xingcheng. Nurhachi died in the same year. The Battle of Ningyuan 宁远之战 (Xingcheng used to be named Ningyuan) was the first battle that Ming defeated Jin. It was an important battle in Ming's history."

"Bangkok/Rattanakosin | see | Wat Saket and the Golden Mount | Wat Saket, the late 18th-century, the next century, Wat Saket's, the Golden Mount, the early 19th-century, King Rama III, today, Buddha, Buddha, the first week of November","Wat Saket was built outside of the former city walls in the late 18th-century in the reign of King Rama I. It served as the capital's crematorium, and throughout the next century became the dumping ground of over 60,000 plague victims who were too poor to afford a funeral. Wat Saket's major feature is the Golden Mount, an artificial hill dating from the early 19th-century. A huge chedi was built on top of the hill in the reign of King Rama III, but it collapsed during the construction process as the soil was too soft to support it. King Rama V bricked in the debris and started construction on a more modest chedi that still exists today. He placed some relics inside the chedi, by some believed to be the Buddha's teeth. A spiral staircase of 318 steps leads from the ground to a terrace and shrine-room — the Buddha's relics are housed in a gold-leaf-covered shrine at the centre of this area. Note that while the shrine itself is an ancient structure that creates an atmosphere worthy of respect, the area just below is more akin to a tacky fairground than one that leads to one of the nation's most sacred sites. Also, the harsh way of requesting the entrance fee does little to inspire the worthy pilgrim or traveller. In short, the shrine is definitely worth including in a travel itinerary, but do not expect a quiet and respectful environment. In the first week of November, the mount is illuminated with coloured lanterns and the compound turns into a large fun fair."

The Castle is the most complete and authentic medieval fortress in Ireland.  Built in 1425 it was restored in 1954 to its former medieval splendour and now contains mainly 15th and 16th century furnishings, tapestries, and works of art which capture the mood of those times. Today, the castle stands peacefully in delightful grounds. The houses and cottages of the folk park spread out at the foot of its massive walls, much in the way that the cottages and crofts of old would have clustered around its base.  Within the grounds of Bunratty Castle is Bunratty Folk Park where 19th century life is vividly recreated. Set on 26 acres, the impressive park features over 30 buildings in a ‘living’ village and rural setting.  Meet and chat with the Bean an Ti (Woman of the House) and various street characters including the Policeman and Schoolteacher who give the site its sparkle.  Enjoy the tastes, scents, sights and sounds of this enchanting place as you stroll from house to house or around the charming village complete with school, post office, doctors house, hardware shop, printers and of course the pub! It’s a wonderful experience for adults and children alike with something for everyone to enjoy!  Another very interesting feature is the formal Bunratty Walled Garden, modelled on the original Regency period garden which supplied fruit, vegetables, and flowers to Bunratty House built in 1804 and now refurbished in typical Victorian style."
"Buffalo/Downtown | eat | Just Fries | Raclette, Don Warfe's, June 2016, the end of a, 19-month-long, 1845, a nice day, Buffalo, French, Allen Street Poutine Company'', Angus, cheddar, German, Johnnie Ryan''', Jerk, Warfe, Main Street","Ask local foodies what was the most anticipated restaurant opening in recent memory on the 500 Block of Main Street, and they'll invariably say '''Raclette's'''. But a solid second place has to be Don Warfe's lunchtime spot just a few doors down, which opened its doors in June 2016 at the end of a 19-month-long, stem-to-stern restoration of the historic '''Genesee Block''', the oldest building on the 500 Block (''c.'' 1845). The first rule of thumb for Just Fries is not to let yourself be put off by the lines that routinely stretch out the door — service is lightning-fast, and the food is worth it. That being said, for best results you should not bother holding out for a table in the postage stamp-sized dining room: if it's a nice day you can enjoy a nice ''al fresco'' lunch at one of the tables on '''Roosevelt Plaza''', or else take your order to go. As for the menu, the inevitable comparison is with Buffalo's other ""French fries as main course"" eatery, the ever-popular '''Allen Street Poutine Company''', and there are indeed some similarities — real, honest-to-goodness poutine is one of the biggest sellers here, available in both the classic fries-gravy-cheese curd setup and ""Buffalo style"" with blue cheese and hot sauce. But for the most part, the loaded-fry platters that make up the real backbone of the menu are distinct entities: the low prices they charge belie the size of the portions and the high quality of the ingredients. Standouts include the souvlaki fries (topped with marinated beef, feta, and ''tzatziki'' sauce), the ''pizza fritta'' (melted mozzarella, marinara sauce, and pepperoni), and the cheeseburger fries (ground Angus beef, cheddar, ketchup, and pickles). Surprisingly enough, the place's major weak spot are the fries themselves: Warfe makes much of the imported German ""air fryer"" he's purchased to cook up healthier fries with 40% less fat and 30% less calories, but consensus says a bit of the flavor is lost with that method. To drink you have a selection of locally-bottled '''Johnnie Ryan''' craft sodas or — in a nod to '''Jerk's''', the old-school malt shop and soda fountain Warfe owns a block down Main Street — homemade milkshakes."

It's Jan Hus, the great Czech religious reformer whose Hussite movement caused as much, if not more, friction within the Christian community as Martin Luther. The statue was erected on the 500th anniversary of his death (6 July 1915). Hus preached in the Bethlehem Church in Old Town and was himself not particularly radical, unlike some of the sects who followed him. He believed in Bibles written in the worshiper's language, in the importance of faith instead of a clergyman's intermediation with God - in other words, concepts which threatened the status quo. He was summoned to the Church's Council of Constance in Switzerland by representatives of the Emperor, and given a letter of safe conduct to get there and back. Like every member of the Habsburg family, before and after him, the Emperor was Catholic. After Hus refused to repent for his so-called sins and come back into the Church, he was burned at the stake, despite the promise of the Emperor."

The beach itself is nothing special, only made of mud grey sand, but it’s fun for people spotting and attract many families and tourists throughout the year. This was the world's most popular silver-sand beach and health resort throughout the 20th century, but it was affected by an oil spill in 2003 when the Greek registered oil tanker ''MV Tasman Spirit'' ran aground and over 12,000 tons of oil spilled into the Arabian Sea in what is considered by some to be the largest environmental disaster in Pakistan's history, so it is better take a stroll rather than swim in the sea because of polluted sea water and strong currents. You can also enjoy horse or camel riding and hop on a dune buggy to roam around the beach area. Many grilled corn stalls can be found on the beach and many fast food kiosks. As the sun sets, flood lights come on and the beach starts getting crowded with the picnic continuing until midnight. Street lights dotting the kilometre long promenade increase the beauty of the sea and surrounding areas. The beach tends to attract children, teenagers, vendors, lovers, kite flyers, merrymakers, and families. Usually on Saturday and Sunday evenings, the land is filled with day-trippers, food vendors, and people picnicking which make it very crowded especially during public holidays and on weekends. On weekends, you can also spot a fountain on eastern side which is built near the series of islets off the coast of the Karachi harbour and attract many people. Overall, the beach is a nice place to spend time. Also take a long walk along the Clifton beach and you'll found locals as well walking, under clear skies, at sundown for a spectacular view while at night is an experience worth the travel alone, as visitors can gaze towards the heavens while the Arabian sea cascades over their sandalled feet. You can either start walking from McDonalds or from Village restaurant. Small parts are located at both ends where you can relax after the long tiring walk."

Though the ""Reimagine"" moniker is still used to refer to the line of Mid-Century Modern furniture that has always been the store's main focus, the name '''Ró''' (which means ""tranquil"" in Danish) was chosen to emphasize the store's expansion into sleek, stylish Scandinavian furniture and housewares, and to encapsulate its new identity as ""a concept of calm living through functional design"". Other new items you'll find here, many of which aren't available anywhere else in Western New York, include specialty housewares from a range of emerging design firms, many of which are based in Brooklyn. As a continuation of its commitment to ecological sustainability, Ró also deals in reclaimed items sourced from abandoned industrial sites and other places around Buffalo. Art shows are also held on a bi-monthly basis, where the work of local artists is exhibited."

Now it houses the Museum of Applied Art and from the walls you can watch the panorama of the Old Town. Poznań King's Castle was the place of the Fist Prussian Homage in 1492 (however more famous is the second one presented on famous picture painted by Jan Matejko).

The ""high-end food and service at street-level prices"" credo under which Lloyd's trucks operate applies equally to the Taco Factory: the menu combines a curated selection of the most popular options from the truck (now if you want your fix of Tricked Out Nachos or the ""Dirty South"" dessert burrito, you know exactly where to find it on any given day) with some interesting new creations (the ""El Hombre"" quesadilla is probably the most popular of these, with chorizo lending a smoky aroma to a cheese-based filling that also includes potato, onion, and avocado crema, while the ""Mexicali Spring Rolls"" sees Lloyd dabbling in Asian fusion, stuffed with a cheese and mushroom mixture spiced up ever-so-slightly with charred poblano pepper with two different sauces for dipping). No matter what you order, you can be sure that it's done up right: everything is made with free-range, antibiotic- and hormone-free meats and locally grown produce and served on house-made corn tortillas made through the traditional ''nixtamalization'' process, the only restaurant between Chicago and New York City that does this. There's also a full cocktail bar with the best selection of mezcal in town, plus a wealth of specialty cocktails that are a bit pricey but worth it. It bears emphasizing that this is one of the most popular new restaurants in Buffalo — waits of over two hours for tables are not uncommon at peak days and times, and reservations aren't accepted, so maybe save Lloyd for when you're hungry outside of normal lunch or dinner hours."

And when the Buffalo location finally opened in February 2014, the local barbecue scene, formerly nothing to write home about, got a major shot in the arm: even the most ardent ""Buffalovers"" who've experienced it concede that local favorite-by-default '''Fat Bob's''' has some major catching up to do. Situated in a former Universal International Pictures film vault on Franklin Street, this location is smaller than others in the chain, but it's got the same rowdy roadhouse vibe and is brimming with historic character to boot. Dinosaur's fare is Kansas City barbecue done to perfection, lauded on the Travel Channel series ''Man v. Food'' and cited by many reviewers, media outlets, and satisfied customers as the best barbecue north of the Mason-Dixon Line — and by ABC's ''Good Morning America'' as the best in the whole country. Start with appetizers like out-of-this-world fried green tomatoes or ""Dino poutine"" topped with pulled pork, then move on to mains such as barbecue chicken, pulled pork, hand-sliced brisket, and catfish that come with your choice of sides (the mac & cheese is to die for and the peel-and-eat ""drunken spicy shrimp"" are gargantuan, but stay away from the bland ""A.K. Chili"") or as part of a range of combo platters, including a build-your-own option. Also available are some of the most mouth-watering ribs you've ever tasted, marinated all day in a secret spice rub then slowly smoked and glazed with just the right amount of Dinosaur's own barbecue sauce. Prices are decent, especially given the ''huge'' portions — those who are not so hungry might prefer lighter fare such as brisket and pulled pork sandwiches or various burgers — and service is efficient and exceptional, with a staff that's friendly to a fault and happy to point newbies to the best dishes on the menu."

In 2007, the Chinese-owned Kings Romans Group entered into a 99-year lease for 10,000 hectares on the banks of the Mekong. The company was granted 3,000 of these hectares as a duty-free zone, now the SEZ. As gambling is illegal in China, and the SEZ is only a two-hour journey by road from China, casinos and hotels catering to a Chinese clientele were built. As an unintended consequence, a robust industry involving trafficking in endangered animals has grown up around the Chinese tourist trade. Several restaurants in the SEZ serve exotic meats: tiger, pangolin, bear cub and python. Menus openly include such fare as bear paw, monitor lizards, geckos, snakes and turtles. Tiger bone wine is also frequently served. Shops in the SEZ sell animal parts, stuffed animals and ivory, all in contravention of the CITES treaty to which Laos is a party. Has to be seen to be believed — and lamented."

The castle is first mentioned in the records in the year 948, and initial construction of the castle ruins remaining today began in the 13th century. The 14th and 15th centuries saw expansion, followed by construction of reinforcements in the 16th. It was owned by the Barons von Frankenstein who owned most of the surrounding land until 1662, when the Baron of that time sold the property to the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt. There have been claims that the castle may have inspired the Mary Shelley novel, Frankenstein.

The complex of interlocked houses and farmsteads, erected in the local sandstone but painted with white walls, is situated between the Saint Pancratius Church and Jourdain castle. There is evidence of a stronghold historically situated west of the current location of the church, but it was demolished by the end of the 14th century because it lost its strategic importance. A map of 1397 only reports the location of the moats (''fossa castri''), which were eventually backfilled and repurposed. Today, no visible evidence remains of the stronghold's existence. From the 14th century to the 19th century, High Kraainem remained a small settlement: at the time of the Belgian independence in 1830, only 15 houses were counted in High Kraainem."

Visitors can see the Geumgangsan (Diamond Mountains) and the Haegeumgang in North Korea, with the naked eye, and unlike many other observatories, photographs are allowed everywhere. In the observatory North Korean food products are for sale, and the North Korean beer is actually quite good. Several clunky North Korean-made Viewmasters give three-dimensional slide shows of idyllic scenes from North Korea, with commentary in Korean, for a 500 Won coin. The windy road to the observatory brings forth a sense of tension due to the barbed-wire entanglements along the coast and soldiers stationed on alert at a checkpoint along the approach. Tickets and passage papers have to be obtained 4km before the first checkpoint or you will be made to turn around. The building to obtain these papers is not hard to find, it is on the left as you drive North just after the ""World Mineral Museum,"" but the sign 100m before it is only in Korean."

He was honored and asked if it was allowed to name the inn after him. Since then, it bare the name 'De Jonghe Graef van Buuren' (The Young Prince van Buuren).

Scott's, '69, Royal Exchange, Barristers, the day, St. Ann's, Cross Street, the last day, 1969","The neo-classical Royal Exchange was the commercial heart of Manchester's and therefore the world's cotton trade. The main trading hall, essentially a neo-Roman basilica, was at one time the largest commercial room in the world. It fell into disuse in the 1960s, but was rescued in the 1970s by the restoration of the building and the addition of an ultra-modern theatre in-the-round for Sir Robert D.H. Scott's '69 (now Royal Exchange) theatre Company. It stands in the centre of the main trading floor, squatting like an alien invader's spaceship, but is actually supported on the hall's load bearing columns. Ill-disposed members of the audience sitting in the theatre's surrounding on-stage banquette seats are well-placed to trip the actors up physically. Extensive wine merchant cellars have now been converted into a shopping centre and the wings surrounding the theatre hall contain offices and Barristers' chambers. Pop in during the day for a coffee or something stronger at the tranquil and elegant licensed cafe in the main hall: the entrance is up the stairs in St. Ann's Square or on Cross Street.

Here, freighters docked and unloaded their cargo of iron ore from the Midwest to be milled into pig iron by, at the company's peak, a workforce of 800 at a rate of 3,100 tons (2,800 metric tons) per day. Like the rest of the Western New York steel industry, Hanna Furnace went belly-up in the 1980s, but the peaceful, pleasant park that's on the site today pays homage to its predecessor in a number of ways: dense groves of trees mimic the towering buildings that once lined the canal, artificial hills recall heaps of limestone and ore, its east end is anchored by a massive ladle once used to pour molten iron into molds to harden, even the pavement design of the walking paths along the canal's edge echoes the pattern of the railroads that used to be there. Ship Canal Commons also boasts over two miles (3 km) of nature trails and a lovely footbridge over the canal, and its waters are fully ecologically restored and boast aquatic plants, waterfowl, and fish such as smallmouth bass and perch. As the southern end of the '''Industrial Heritage Trail''', Ship Canal Commons is easy to reach by bike and on foot via the footbridge at the south end of the '''Outer Harbor Parkway''', but automobile access is trickier: you have to take either Tifft Street or Ridge Road and wind your way through the industrial park."

According to the local rumour, its name (which in Turkish means ""mirrored poplar"") derives from the now absent mirrors gifted by Venice to the palace that were presumably ""as tall as the poplars"" (''aynalar kavak''). The '''highly decorative and colourful interior''' includes several rooms of original furnitures fit for a sultan, some of which are covered with nacre, and walls embellished with Ottoman poems praising the palace and Selim III. Downstairs is a small museum dedicated to music, which exhibit some of the instruments (violins, ouds, and kamanchehs) and gramophone records owned by Fatma Gevheri Sultana (1904–1980), the granddaughter of Abdülaziz I (r. 1861–1876). While you are outside, also check out the old main entrance (now closed) towards the Golden Horn, topped by a dome. Worth the half hour spent there."

In Roman times, this section of riverside was a series of quarries where stone was extracted for building the fortress. In Saxon times, The Groves was probably the main port area and may have had a concentration of leatherworking.<p>:The Groves is also the best place to go to take a trip down the river itself through all manner of vessels from motorised tour-boats to row boats and, in warm weather, even pedaloes."

Indeed, despite the multicultural vibrancy of the restaurants that have come and gone from the International Kitchen in the years since '''Jolie's Traditional Chinese Food''' moved to the '''Horsefeathers Market''' on the Lower West Side, it's always seemed to many like there's been something missing. Enter Maung Maung Saw, a native of Myanmar whose stock in trade are the ''dim sum'' and other delectable little Chinese appetizers whose recipes he perfected at the restaurant he and his family ran in Malaysia before coming to Buffalo. The stars of the show on 007's modest-sized menu are the ''lo mai fan'' (balls of sticky rice mixed with stir-fried chicken and mushrooms, with sriracha sauce on the side for dipping), and of course, the steamed ''shu mai'' stuffed with your choice of beef, chicken, or vegetables. You probably won't be able to make a full meal out of any of these items, but they work spectacularly as appetizers to accompany a main course from one of the Bazaar's other food vendors — whatever you order here, be assured it's prepared fresh by hand in front of you and bursting with flavor (the exception being the ''pau'', which, even more than usual with Chinese steamed buns, tend toward the dry and doughy.) Complimentary hot tea is served with any order on request. Service at 007 is as friendly as can be, but often complicated by a language barrier — Maung's wife, who you'll often see running the restaurant, speaks very little English; if you have more complex questions or comments, you should seek out her husband or son, who are fluent."

Around 1600, during the rule of Rudolph II, the castle was redesigned and expanded according to plans by the Dutch master builder Anton Muys. The powerful four-story block with two inner courtyards and the main gate to the city (Rudolfstor 1604) date from this time. During the Napoleonic wars the building served as a military hospital, and it was here that the great city fire of 1800 broke out (destruction of the south wing and a part of the transept). Beginning in 1811, the remaining buildings were used as the provincial prison and from 1851 until 1945 as a barracks.  :Between 1953 and 1963, the fortress was rebuilt and restored as the '''Schlossmuseum Linz'''. It contains permanent exhibitions of art from the Middle Ages to the present day, historical weapons and musical instruments, coins, folklore and technical history, as well as the Kastner collection.

Tickets are 10,000 Gs. per person. Locals will happily shout ""Ruinas!"" as you approach; return buses are caught from the shelter across the road from where you disembark at a crossroads. The road to the right leads you to Trinidad, the Jesuit capital, and the ticket office. It is a 5 minute walk. Your 25,000 Gs. ticket is valid for three days, and gets you in to all three ruins near Encarnación. Trinidad has a small museum. Jesús is down the left hand road from the crossroads, but it is 10km away. You can rent a bike at the Ruinas hotel (right beside the Trinidad ruins), or take a moto-taxi for 30,000 Gs. Try to share - they can carry four people. The ruins are well worth a visit; bring lunch and enjoy it in the old Plaza Mejor."

Both venues are great, the Lansburgh being a long-time favorite and a smaller, intimate space, and the Harman Hall being big, flashy, and state-of-the-art.

"Buffalo/Allentown and the Delaware District | see | Delaware Park Rose Garden | Delaware Park's, Rose Garden, Lincoln Parkway, the Marcy Casino, season, All-America Rose Selections, Olmsted, 1912, the Rose Garden, Delaware Park","Delaware Park's beautiful Rose Garden is located directly off Lincoln Parkway behind the Marcy Casino, and blooms in season with thirty-three beds of beautiful red, purple, yellow and white roses, many varieties of which have been honored in the past as All-America Rose Selections. The rose garden was not part of Olmsted's original design for the park, but was instead added to the park in 1912. Although its formality contrasts incongruously with the quiet, curvilinear naturalism of the park's original features, the Rose Garden is nonetheless lovely and renowned, and was recently subjected to a thorough restoration at the hands of the '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy'''. The impeccably manicured garden also includes a working fountain and pyramidal trellises, and a grand pergola at its rear. The garden, and Delaware Park in general, is immensely popular with bridal parties during rose season; don't be surprised if you have to dodge gaggles of bridesmaids posing for endless pictures!"

A hundred years ago, the scene at the foot of Smith Street was dominated by railroad tracks, trains, industrial facilities, and freighters plying their way up and down the river, but the only legacy of that period left today are a couple of railroad bridges and the foundation of a traffic control tower that was demolished in the 1980s. What Red Jacket Riverfront Park ''does'' have is plenty of shady spots for fishing and picnicking, great views of the inland end of Elevator Alley (including the quarter-mile-long [400m long] '''Concrete-Central Elevator''', Buffalo's largest), walking trails, and a boggy wetland area that's reminiscent of what was here before the encroachment of industry.

At Sato 2.0, the three flagship ramen selections of the original restaurant are joined by Buffalo Chicken Ramen (the titular meat with corn, scallions, carrots, and black garlic oil in chicken broth), as well as Kimchi Ramen in a mixed pork and chicken broth.

The statue has been in possession of the foundation since 1958, when it was taken out of China and placed inside the temple.

The pride of La Tavola, their expensive 100% wood-fired pizza oven, turns out not only delicious homemade pizzas (which tend more toward the traditional Italian side of the spectrum, perhaps more so than any other place in Buffalo) but also other specialties such as stuffed peppers.

That's the year when Guido Colla, a native of Crespano del Grappa, Italy who was then working as a machinist for local pasta manufacturer '''Gioia''', designed and built his own pasta maker and began cooking ravioli in the kitchen of the West Side house he shared with his wife Maria — ravioli which quickly became a neighborhood sensation. Ravioli is still the marquee product customers line up for in this cramped little shop in Black Rock. It's made daily in-house from scratch with a simple recipe of durum flour, water, and eggs — there's no additives or chemicals in this stuff, which is likely why its quality puts supermarket fare to shame. Into the ravioli are stuffed your choice of cheese, meat, spinach, or lobster (imitation — it's only $4 a tray, after all — but still delicious), and they along with other filled pastas like cheese tortellini and stuffed shells are available fresh or frozen. Gondola's dried pasta boasts a bit more variety; options range from the expected (plain, angel hair, roasted red pepper, garlic pesto) to the unexpected (squid ink?!?)

"Buffalo/South Buffalo | eat | Charlie's Boatyard | October 2015, the next year, the Outer Harbor, Charlie, the Dug's Dive days, hardwood floors, Charlie, Asian, Prince Edward Island, cheddar, an hour, the Outer Harbor, Charlie","When '''Dug's Dive''' closed down in October 2015 with promises to reopen the next year under a new name and management, locals had high hopes: the long-held consensus regarding that place was that its appeal began and ended with its location right at the center of the Outer Harbor action, with undoubtedly the best lakefront views in the whole city; the overpriced, underwhelming food seemed almost an afterthought. Is Charlie's Boat Yard an improvement? In some ways yes, in some ways no. Let's start with the pros before moving on to the cons: the place has been fully renovated from the Dug's Dive days, inside (a pleasant airy interior with hardwood floors and open windows to let in the lake breezes) and out (an expanded patio that features round hightop tables made from repurposed channel markers, an outdoor bar, and occasional live music), for a result that's decidedly more upscale than its predecessor, but still the kind of place you can feel comfortable strolling into from your boat in shorts and flipflops. As well, there seems to have been more thought put into the food here, as well as more consideration for those who don't like seafood: it's still the foundation of Charlie's menu (especially among the appetizers and small plates, which features raw or steamed clams, an Asian-inspired plate of seared tuna with fried wontons, Prince Edward Island mussels in a pomodoro sauce, and a shrimp po' boy drizzled in creole aioli), but the most popular and best-loved options tend to be the ones without seafood (the house special ""Boatyard Burger"" with avocado, cheddar cheese and salsa verde is a winner, as is the apple walnut salad with roasted red peppers and crumbled blue cheese). On the minus side, the actual quality of the food gets mixed reviews, and the service is, if anything, ''worse'' than Dug's — waits of an hour or more are the rule rather than the exception no matter how crowded the place is, and waitstaff tends to be inattentive, inexperienced, and unfriendly. Still, they're pretty much the only game in town on the Outer Harbor, so if you can take the good with the bad, Charlie's might be worth your while."

As before, bagels remain BreadHive's best-known specialty, and they're out of this world — house-made the traditional way with locally-grown organic flour and wild yeast, deliciously hefty, and available in eight flavors slathered generously with goat cheese — and they still offer fresh-baked breads like the flagship ""West Side Sourdough"", multigrain, deli rye and Danish-style ''rugbrød'', as well as soft pretzels, pastry, and homemade granola. But with the new location has come an expanded concept, and at lunchtime BreadHive serves a slate of delicious sandwiches all named for the owners' favorite female musicians — favorites include ""The Robyn"" (basically a Reuben, except with pastrami in place of corned beef; the beet caraway sauerkraut is sourced from the West Side's own '''Barrel + Brine''') and ""The Bjork"" (a vegan-friendly concoction with tempeh ""bacon"" that really intrigued the reviewer in a recent edition of ''Buffalo Rising'').

"Bandhavgarh National Park | see | Fossil National Park | Fossil National Park, Bandhavgarh, India, The Fossils National Park, Bryophytes, mid-Cretaceous age, Pangaea, Laurasia, India, Gondwanaland, about 40 million years ago","Fossil National Park is situated 110&nbsp;km from Bandhavgarh, This national park has plants in fossil form that existed in India anywhere between 40 million and 150 million years ago.The Fossils National Park is an area that spreads over 274,100 square metres. Such fossils are found in three villages, which lie outside the national park. The Standing, petrified trunks of trees have been identified as Gymnosperms and Angiosperms- Monocotyledons and palms. There are certain Bryophytes also. There is some doubt about whether the fossils are from the late Jurassic or the early and mid-Cretaceous age. This is because when the breakup of the single land mass, Pangaea occurred, it was split by the continental drift into Laurasia and Gondwanaland somewhere between the Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. India formed a part of Gondwanaland. Interspersed with the plant fossils are to be found the fossils of molluscs. These are about 40 million years ago. The fossils look like ordinary rocks."

If you'd like to see a Bears game, then you have something in common with many Chicagoans; there's no point in listing ticket prices, because they sell out long before the season starts. The original Soldier Field was built in 1924 to honor veterans of the First World War, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. By 2002, the stadium was in dire need of renovations, and the Bears promised to preserve the majestic colonnades of the old stadium. However, when the renovations were complete, what appeared to be a giant spaceship had landed at mid-field. The amenities have improved, and it really is a nice facility...on the inside. On the outside, it's hard to say ''what'' it is, other than probably the strangest-looking sports arena in America.

Today, Polish and other Eastern European foods and gifts still predominate, but the Market's offerings are slowly diversifying to better reflect the vibrant pastiche of the modern-day East Side, with soul food stands, halal groceries, and other eclectic goods on offer. The Market is most popular in the weeks leading up to Easter, when Buffalonians crowd through the doors in search of savory ''kielbasa'' and Polish hams, traditional pastries like ''chruściki'' and ''placek'', and the '''butter lambs''' that are a tradition peculiar to Buffalo. But it's worthwhile to visit during other times of the year too, when it's quiet enough to get a real feel for the place — outside the Easter season, Saturday is the best day to go, as many if not most of the stalls close on weekdays."

Now owned by the five Guercio sons, the business is once again thriving — Guercio's is one of Buffalo's prime destinations for Italian foods, both imports and locally produced items such as sliced bread from '''Luigi's Bakery''' and '''Anchor Bar''' brand wing sauce.

Options include a ""Buffalo roll"" with cream cheese, crab salad, and cucumber, as well as the mango banana roll, probably the place's most popular, which is prepared with fish sauce for a bit of extra spice. In fact, ""a bit of spice"" is an excellent summation of the main non-sushi item on the menu: the ''rakhaing mutee'', a variation of classic Burmese ''mohinga'' particular to Rakhine State, though Rakhapura's version substitutes chicken broth for the usual base of conger eel. It's a hearty, healthy, and indescribably delicious soup; a garlicky, slightly tangy broth with rice vermicelli and coriander, served with dried, crushed red chilis on the side if you want a bit more heat. Perhaps the best part of Rakhapura, however, is the owner: a longtime pro-democracy agitator, Thein escaped Myanmar with his life in 1996 and now spends his off hours lecturing around the area on the political and human rights situation in his homeland, which often makes for interesting conversations with customers!"

Austin's Congress Avenue bridge is home to about 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats. This is the largest urban bat colony in the world and one of the largest Mexican free-tailed bat colonies in North America. The bats are generally active at dusk every evening between March and November. In years when there has been a drought, the bats leave early (when there is still light), and can be a quite impressive sight. In years when there has been plenty of rain, they leave so late it is difficult to see much. Best place to see them is near the Austin American Statesman's parking lot, or you can pay for boat tours to see them from underneath the bridge.

Owner Luis Martinez's desire was to bring the subtle, delightful flavors of Puerto Rican cuisine out of the barrio and into the larger Buffalo restaurant scene; in a recent write-up on buffalo.com, he remarked: ""My people... already know about [Puerto Rican] food. I want to attract the Italians, the white people of North Buffalo and introduce them"" to it. La Kueva is already receiving rave reviews from Buffalonians for its take on Hispano-Caribbean favorites like pollo guisado, pastelones, and various tropical drinks, but for less adventurous diners, a range of sandwiches is available as well."

At the Winter Market on Hertel, you can get everything from locally-raised meat, dairy, eggs and greenhouse produce to jams and jellies, baked goods, bath products, and even gourmet dog treats and hand-crocheted plush toys and accessories — at a time of year when most farmers' markets close up shop.

A brick wall, 87 meters in diameter, carried an earth mound covered with cypresses. On top of the hill stood a bronze monument of the emperor. The building was 44 meters high. At the beginning of the alley, which led to the tomb were two Egyptian obelisks. On both sides of the doorway bronze plates describe the ""Res gestae"", the deeds of the emperor. The urns of Augustus, Marcellus, Octavia, Agrippa, Drusus and other members of the Julian Claudian dynasty were revered here. In the Middles Ages the building served as citadel of the Colonna family. It was destroyed by ''Pope Gregor IX'' in 1241. The body of ''Cola di Rienzo''. a popular leader of the people in the mid-14th Century, was burnt in this monument.

On religious holidays there will be no alcohol sales at any time. Holidays can last for several days. Smaller corner shops will be happy to sell you alcohol anytime they are open. 2) The northern Khuk Khak 7-Eleven, located at the PTT gas station (km790.5), does not sell any alcohol.

The owners claim to be going for a ""modern speakeasy"" vibe, a nod to the real-life one that operated in the basement of this same building during Prohibition — but in reality the sleek lines, pastel tones, minimalist decor, and spherical hanging lights say ""midcentury"" much more than ""Roaring Twenties"". The real highlight at Billy Club is the bar, where top-shelf whiskey, bourbon, and Scotch rule the day, but equally worthwhile is the small but expertly crafted selection of upscale pub grub served up from the kitchen by head chef Scott Crombie — check out the ""House Grind Burger"" topped with arugula, pickled onions, and blue cheese; the hanger steak that comes dressed with braised onions and mini potatoes and drizzled in a blue cheese ''jus''; and a cheese and charcuterie plate courtesy of Buffalo's own '''Nickel City Cheese and Mercantile'''."

Trinity United, to the dismay of its congregants, rocketed to international infamy in the space of seconds during then Senator Obama's presidential campaign, when news outlets got their hands on a fiery sermon by the then pastor Jeremiah Wright. In the now famous clip, replayed endlessly for weeks across the cable news networks, Rev. Wright cried out, ""God damn America!"" The ensuing characterization of the church was hardly fair, with the short clip shown out of context, and the context itself being one very much alien to most Americans, who had not had any experience of the often radical social justice traditions of the African-American Church. In part because he was unhappy to see his former congregation harassed by reporters, and in part because his increasingly flamboyant pastor was continuing to embarrass and hurt his campaign, Obama left the church, allowing things to calm down over time, and for the congregation to get back to its purposes of worship and charity."

The museum can be toured in about an hour. The sculptures are nearly all made of sandstone, and some have weathered badly over the centuries, but you can still appreciate the delightful artistic quality of the figures, which include shiva, garudas, nagas, lions, monkeys, and elephants. The collection also includes striking examples of the ancient Hindu icons of fertility: lingam altars decorated around the sides with rows of breasts. The sculptures were mostly removed from the facades or interiors of Cham ruins (which would have been looted otherwise.) The ruins themselves, such as nearby My Son, now tend to be crumbling piles of bricks and somewhat disappointing, giving little sense of the spectacular artwork produced by the Cham civilization. Any visit to My Son should be paired with a visit to the Cham Museum. The collection is also interesting to compare with Balinese sculpture and the early, Hindu phase of Angkor Wat in Cambodia."

Unfortunately, it is also one of the biggest tourist traps in Myanmar, because you will visit 3-6 workshops selling items for Western prices. Most of the workshops are only set up for tourists and if you wish, you can tell your driver that you don't want to visit any of them. However, the trip to see the local small-scale industries and arts is worth it.   Right after leaving the canal to the open lake you will see two guys in traditional clothes standing on one leg in their boat and posing with a fishing basket, presenting then dead caught fish and will finally ask for tips. Full day trip takes about 7 hours and costs 15000-20000 K, driver will go wherever you tell them to, but remember that he is not a guide nor does he necessarily speak English. Any guesthouse or travel agency can arrange this trip for you. You may have a better experience by chartering a boat directly, clearly agreeing on the planned stops, and starting very early in the morning before most other tour boats, and also allowing you to arrive at market while it's busy. As of 2015, locals claim that the floating market doesn't exist any more due to too many tourists.   You may consider going to these common stops:  * Teak and Cheroot: Nan Pan market contains a teak wood workshop and cheroot-making. See and learn how boats are build, and browse through small teak wood souvenirs. See the local cheroots (cigars) being made, but you want to skip buying it here because you get the same stuff at 6 times lower price in the city * Weaving: In Paw Khae, learn how thread is made and fabric weaved from lotus root string, apart from cotton and silk. * Shan paper: See how Shan paper is made from wood, into colourful lamps and fans. * Workshop of long neck people - a few ladies in their traditional clothing as an 'advertisement'. This can be a disturbing sight for some. * Gold and silverware: Most tours will have a dysfunctional forge showing you how the silver is poured and molded into rings, 'Shan style earrings' and other jewellery. * Floating village and restaurants: Good options for sea-food * Floating garden : you can see tomatoes and aubergines among other veggies being grown * Lay Phaung Daw Oo Pagoda: Contains 5 small Buddha statues covered with so much gold leaf that they look like golden snowmen. You can see pictures on the walls for their original appearance. You will also see tales from Buddha's life, and the story of how the Buddha statues were brought here through an adventurous route, on the walls through colourful depictions. * Inthar Heritage House, Jumping Cat Monastery - so called because the monks had once trained the cats to jump. But the old monk has already passed away, so the cats are not jumping any more. Still, it is a nice monastery worth the ambience. You can lose yourself merely interpreting the Buddha stories on the walls. * Sunset at the lake. When your boatman approaches a fisherman, he will do the symbolic and famous Inle fisherman pose for you, balancing their net on one leg and leaning over the water. But as you near them, you will find outstretched hands demanding money for the pose. You should to tell your boatman not to wait near the fishermen if you do not wish to pay them. * Informative guided tours are provided by the shops for free. Bring cash if you consider buying souvenirs (e.g. lotus fabric USD 30-80).   For '''Solo travellers in low season:''' It might be hard to find others to join. So walk around the jetty and the bridge. Most boats depart between 8-11am. '''Respect''': Do not take people's photo when they are showering or washing plates."

However, it was Casper Reinwardt who adopted the gardens and directed their scientific use, with Johannes Elias Teysmann continuing in his footsteps. Today, the gardens stretch out over 87 hectares, including some carefully manicured gardens as well as areas that look and feel like wild jungle. Fountains, lakes, two rivers and hilly trails make for interesting walking that can easily take 2 days if you really want to see it all. If you visit in January you may be able to spot a blooming giant arum (''Amorphophallus titanum''), the world's tallest inflorescence (flower cluster) which can reach an astounding 2.5 m and smells like rotting meat. The walk around the garden can be long. Taking the tour bus for a quick trip around the garden will give you some better information about planning your walk on foot.

Alternatively, you can look down and see the beautifully manicured herb garden and the length of the pergola stretching out before you. The adjacent Hill Garden offers a complete contrast to the wildness of the pergola. The garden is beautifully manicured and is a favourite haunt for artists.

The excavations show remains of a large settlement, with ruins of a castle, a cemetery, a baths, an Hellenistic theatre and a temples of the mysterious, once only on Lemnos and its neighbouring island of Samothrace manicured worship of Cabeiri, a “Sanctuary of the Great Gods”. The identity and nature of the deities venerated at the sanctuary remains largely enigmatic, in large part because it was taboo to pronounce their names. Literary sources from antiquity refer to them under the collective name of ""Cabeiri"", while they carry the simpler epithet of Great Gods, which was a title or state of being rather than the actual name. The cult of the Great Gods existed in ancient Greece as one of several mystery cults in addition to the worship of the Olympian deities. Mystery cults are cults or religion whose religious doctrines and rites are kept secret from outsiders. The inclusion in such a community of worship was usually carried out by special initiation rites. Because the mystery cults have broadly maintained their secrets, their myths and rites are hardly reconstructed and there are only a lot of conjectures based on ancient writings and archaeological finds.  The sanctuary was destroyed by the Persians in 511 BC. The Athenians conquered Lemnos in the early 5th century and rebuilt Ifestia again, but introduced their politically democratic system. In the the early Byzantine period Ifestia was abandoned because the natural harbour silted up due to continuous soil erosion and developing Christianity was averse to the old mystery cult."

Though the business hasn't stayed completely true to its predecessor — this food isn't Kosher, and traditional Jewish sandwiches such as corned beef, pastrami, and Reuben are joined on the menu by a range of other sandwiches such as muffaletta, Cuban, and a concoction of grilled vegetables and herb cream cheese on a hoagie roll dubbed the Johnny Be Good — the emphasis on freshness and flavor at Joe's has inspired many locals to name it as the purveyor of the best deli sandwiches in Buffalo. Most interesting of all, however, are the wraps, whose variety is truly striking: a Thai chicken wrap, a Greek wrap consisting of feta cheese, olives, and fresh vegetables in Greek dressing, and a hummus wrap are among the offerings."

Note that it is only for foreign tourists, so you ''must'' have a tourist visa (i.e. student and working visas are not acceptable). Non-resident Indians can also book their tickets through this office. Bring your passport and cash or traveller's cheques in Euros, British pounds or US dollars. If you wish to pay in Indian Rupees (₹) you theoretically ''must'' show an official exchange certificate (from India, not valid if you changed in another country) or an ATM receipt. All ticket bookings require exact change, as like everywhere in India the office has little to no change. If you don't have exact change, it's possible after booking to go down to the food stores, buy food to get change, then return and pick up your ticket. To get a ticket, first go to the centre of the room and get numbers for the reservation and information desks, as well as a form to fill out. Then line up at one of the two u-shaped lines of chairs, fill out the form, and prepare for a protracted wait. When your information number is called, have the clerk check the availability of the train(s) you desire and answer any questions you have about the form. Then wait for your reservation number to be called. Note that by the time you get to the reservation desk, your train may no longer be available, in which case you can try to reserve a different one. If you need a bathroom during this lengthy process, there is a relatively clean male and female toilet just outside on the verandah through the side door (the door you didn't enter through). - The station is large, crowded, confusing and packed with touts. Allow ''one hour'' to find your train the first time you visit. Don't trust the electronic display boards, which often show incorrect information. Instead listen to the announcements and ask multiple people in uniform (policemen) until you find your train."

The church is one of the only structures that was renovated rather than rebuilt. It is best known for a sandstone sculpture called the Spandauer Madonna (1290), but there are other interesting pieces here. When the church was destroyed in 1938 and rebuilt in the 1970s, the communist officials intended to use it as a museum, which did not open until 1987.

Their humongous Harlem location is in an out-of-the-way location that isn't convenient to any subway stop, as it is quite a bit west and somewhat uptown from the #1 stop at 125th St. and Broadway — not very convenient if you are carrying a lot of heavy groceries — and no bus stops really close by, either (the closest you can get is 125th St. and 12th Ave., via the Bx15 limited bus on weekdays and regular bus on weekends). Most of the people who shop at this location probably drive cars, and the store's website promotes the fact that it is near the 125th St. exit from the Henry Hudson Parkway (and therefore convenient for people who work in New York City and want to buy some produce before taking the George Washington Bridge home to New Jersey). However, if you spend more than $200, they guarantee free delivery between 86th and 220th Sts., east and west sides (it costs $7.95 otherwise), and they also offer a free shuttle for groups of 10 or more people, by reservation, with pickup and delivery from and to 64th-181st and 12th Avenue-York Avenue."

Despite sporting a style that's sometimes flashy, with bright, offbeat colors to choose from, what's sold here is classy and sophisticated: these pieces would be much more at home in a high-end men's shop in New York or Los Angeles than on the East Side, as attested to by the thriving online mail-order business these folks do to homes all over the United States.

The highly expensive course is ''omakase'' only - Jiro himself selects 20 nigiri pieces daily based on that day's catch from the Tsukiji fish market. You are not expected to use soy sauce, as many pieces are already brushed with it. The restaurant only has ten counter seats, and due to its popularity, advance reservations are required by telephone in Japanese. While reservations open on the first day of every month for the following month's seating, they almost always sell out the same day. Reservations via a concierge (hotel, American Express, etc.) may be the best way for foreign visitors to secure a seat."
"Buffalo/Allentown and the Delaware District | eat | Fast 'N Tasty | Buffalonians, 2012, Gatur, Ethiopian, opening hours, Ethiopian, Middle Eastern, today, Buffalo Ethiopian, today, Ethiopian, Lebanese, Fast 'N Tasty","This place has always been a conundrum for Buffalonians: opened in 2012 under the name Gatur's as Buffalo's second Ethiopian restaurant (a genre of cuisine long awaited in the city), locals were torn between, on the one hand, food which stood head and shoulders above its competition, and on the other hand, maddeningly unreliable opening hours and service that ranged from merely adequate to downright surly. As time went by and more options for local fans of Ethiopian food emerged, the owners responded by jettisoning half of the menu and replacing it with Middle Eastern specialties such as ''fatoush'', ''kofta'', and ''shawarma'', which further complicated matters. The state of affairs today is a menu that, while awkwardly disjointed, still delivers food that's above average on the scale of Buffalo Ethiopian restaurants, and service that still depends to a great degree on which server you happen to get. If you don't feel like making the trip to the West Side for '''Abyssinia''' (Buffalo's odds-on favorite today for Ethiopian food) — or if you're arguing with a traveling companion who has a hankering for Lebanese — Fast 'N Tasty is still recommendable. Bonus points for some of the most deliciously spiced milk chai in town."

In the nineties the Ferrari formula one racing team made a present of one of these statues of its famous logo to each of their F1 drivers. This one was shipped to Ireland in 1999 to be given to Eddie Irvine who had finished as runner up in the World championship for Ferrari that year. It was stored in a barn in County Tyrone and was to be a surprise to Irvine. However just before this was to take place Irvine told Ferrari he was leaving them to join the Jaguar team. Ferrari never told Irvine about the statue and it stayed in the barn for a year until a local farmer from Horseleap was up in Tyrone buying cattle and was told about it. A delegation from the village was then dispatched to make the case that they had the ideal home for this statue and that they wished to purchase it. They bought the statue for a fee less than it cost to make and it was erected in 2000.

Evenings are often markedly different in the summer from the coastal cities in the region, as the forests and mountain breezes drop the temperature, making one enjoy being outside and offering great sleeping weather. A light jacket may even be needed if camping. June and early July are often rainy (though the moisture can bring fantastic fog formations that whisk up from the bottom of the valley), and the increased humidity through the season sometimes limit the extent of mountain top views. Mid-July and August have only sporadic rain, but in the late afternoon thunderstorms and short heavy downpours sometimes occur on the hottest days (the mountains of Shikoku tend to harbor these sudden storms). By the end of the summer and early autumn the chance of a typhoon hitting increases (some come as early as June), which can wreck havoc in the valley. Landslides are not uncommon during prolonged downpours, winds are ferocious, and hiking can be very dangerous in forests due to falling trees. If a typhoon is coming, it's time to buckle down in a safe place and wait for it to pass. (see the '''Stay safe''' section for more typhoon info)"

"Ohrid | see | Ohrid Traditional Architecture | Turks, Muslim, Christian, Christians, Macedonia, Ilindenska, Robevci & Uranija, Uranija, today, Uranija, Robevci, St. Gerakomija, Kanevce House''', St. Sophia, Kanevce","When the Turks came they settled on the flat land along the lake and that became the Muslim part of town and the part on the hills inside the walls was always the Christian part, with the bazaar as a meeting place. As the city grew and the Christians were not allowed to build outside the walls, Ohrid developed very specific architecture with tight narrow streets and tunnels (houses built over the streets). The houses had tiny yards usually enclosed in the ground floor, and the houses grew over the streets on the upper floors since the locations were small. The steep terrain enabled everybody to have a good view of the lake and because of the strong sun the houses were painted white, so they would reflect the sun. Because of the winds from the lake the houses in Ohrid don’t have the open spaces that traditional houses in other towns in Macedonia have. Interesting houses can be seen all over the old town but the best examples are along “Car Samoil” and “Ilindenska” streets. '''Robevci & Uranija houses''' are the two best examples of traditional architecture. They are houses of very rich families (normally the houses were not this big). Especially rich in terms of architecture is '''Uranija house''', with entrances on different levels and inside galleries. They have been turned into museums today. If you don’t have time, visit just Uranija this one is free, even though the top level of Robevci has great views, nice wood carvings, and some furniture (100 denars entrance). '''The house next to St. Gerakomija church''' is one of the few traditional houses that has been nicely and carefully preserved. It has been turned into a hotel now; '''Kanevce House''' On the right from the main façade of St. Sophia church, is the small house that belonged to Kanevce family. It has beautiful proportions and it is a good example of how they built on small locations."

About 10 km (6 mi) from Ninghai, it is straightforward to get to because the G15 highway from Ningbo heads directly there with an off-ramp nearby.

Among the 2000 household here 80% of them have “Tong” as the surname. Since it is located in front of the Baixi river, it is named Qiantong (“Qian” meaning “before” or ""in front of""). The town has been around more than 760 years, successive generations of Tongs choosing to remain here. If you've been to other ""ancient towns"" in China, you will know that they run the gamut of being fully functioning towns as just as they were hundreds of years ago, to tourist dumps with nothing but trinket shops and unwashed hordes.

The level of preservation is still very good, although there were a few buildings being rebuilt in the ""old style"".

It seems like they've built up the infrastructure to really push more tourism though, despite relatively few making the trip out, so you might want to check the place out now before it becomes overrun."

Nowadays, the airfield of Tempelhof is a spacious park with many visitors in summer and fall. The terminal building is still fascinating - the halls and neighbouring buildings, intended to become the gateway to Europe, are still known as the largest built entities worldwide. The terminal building is used as a venue of fashion weeks or fairs. Tempelhof has been subject to a lot of local politics in recent years. First a ballot measure to keep it as an airport failed and a few years later a ballot measure to keep new construction on its outskirts from happening was successful, thus preserving the urban open space at the cost of an exacerbated housing shortage."

"Ohrid | see | St. Pantelejmon – Plaoshnik | Christian, Europe, Cyrillic, St. Klement, Christian, the 5th century, Christian, St. Klement, today, St Panteleimon, later in the 13th century, Before St. Klement, Turks","It has been a very important religious center since early Christian times, if not before. It is the site of the first university in Europe, opened in the 10th c. and it is the place where the Cyrillic alphabet was created. The church you see is a reconstruction of the church St. Klement built when he came here and opened the university. The 5 nave early Christian basilica in the middle of which the church stands is from the 5th century (interesting mosaics in the baptistery and in the side chapel covered with red plastic roof). The atrium was built on the side since there was no space in the front. It probably was the cathedral in early Christian times. When St. Klement came here in the 10th c. just the small round chapel that today serves as altar existed. Because of the large influx of worshipers that followed him, he enlarged the church by building the central part of the church and turning the existent church into an altar chapel, and he dedicated the church to St Panteleimon (protector of health). The closed porch and the belltower were added later in the 13th century. Before St. Klement died he dig his own grave inside the church. When the Turks came they torn the church down after a rebellion. It still attracted large number of worshipers and pilgrims so they built a mosque above it. Until recently both the mosque and the church were standing in ruins. The reconstruction is a big guess since they didn't know anything but the shape of the church. The height, the shape of the domes and the decorations are a wild guess."

Students from Brazil pay 50% - R$18 but are usually requested to prove showing some ID or document. The queue for the train, in Cosme Velho, can get rather long; you purchase a ticket for a particular departure time (that day only). The trains run every 30 minutes. Try going when the morning coach parties have already passed through, i.e. when most tourists are having their lunch. Don't take the train too late in the day since late afternoon trains may be cancelled if delays throughout the day build up. This is common over holiday weekends. Take a taxi to Cosme Velho, or take the Metro-Onibus Expresso combination (see above) from the Largo do Machado station. If you opt for a taxi to go up instead of the funicular, it's R$20 round-trip to enter the park, then another R$18 or so for the shuttle up to the monument. After dark, be aware that the steep descent down Corcovado in a shuttle can be dangerous since some less-professional park drivers choose to speed down the mountain to create a roller coaster type effect and even turn the headlights off temporarily to thrill the passengers. If this occurs, passengers should tell the driver to stop by shouting ""Pare!"" (PAH-ree).

You can take a longtail boat to Maya Beach for about 1,500 baht for half a day. It is recommended that you arrive at Maya Bay before 08:00, when the place can still be enjoyed in solitude.

Sandwiches are king at lunchtime — the slate of single- and double-decker concoctions include a delectable Monte Cristo made with either turkey or corned beef — and some interesting burgers are available too, all made with 100% Angus beef patties; these include a ""Buffalo-style burger"" (topped with a mix of blue cheese dressing and '''Frank's''' hot sauce) and a doughnut burger (exactly what it sounds like: a glazed doughnut replaces the bun). A decent selection of homemade soups are also available to go with. But Riverside Café may be even more popular at breakfast, with a gargantuan menu that ranges from the usual permutations of the eggs-toast-sausage-bacon template to more specialized dishes like a pepperoni and salsa omelette and flaky homemade biscuits topped with sausage gravy. Additionally, the Riverside Café is open into dinnertime on Fridays and Saturdays, when locals pack the house to enjoy delicious fish fry — another local favorite. Service here earns mixed reviews; it's quick and efficient but sometimes not so friendly."

"Medieval and Renaissance Italy | other | Assisi | Assisi, the Medieval Saint Francis, the Basilica di San Francesco, Basilica of St. Francis, Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti, 1997, Medieval","Assisi is the city of the Medieval Saint Francis, after whom the current pope took his papal name; accordingly, the Basilica di San Francesco (Basilica of St. Francis), containing work by Cimabue, Giotto, Simone Martini and Pietro Lorenzetti, although damaged in the 1997 earthquake and painstakingly restored, is the highlight among quite a few other Medieval buildings."

"Chicago/Bridgeport-Chinatown | do | U.S. Cellular Field | New Comiskey Park, the White Sox, Cubs, The 2005 World Champion White Sox, 1991, Chicago, Wrigley Field, Sox, Saturday, night, Wrigley, and/or red pepper","Formerly known as New Comiskey Park, this is the home of the White Sox — or, as the name is properly phrased in the company of Cubs fans, The 2005 World Champion White Sox. The stadium itself was a notorious dud when it opened in 1991, but recent renovations have helped tremendously. If you just want to see a Chicago ball game and don't care who is playing, the stately charm of Wrigley Field might be the better option. But Sox tickets are easier to get, the fans are no less loyal, and the fireworks shows after Saturday night home games (win or lose) are worth the price of admission by themselves. For a nifty ballpark treat not offered at Wrigley, try the ''elotes'', corn-off-the-cob with your choice of salt, butter, cheese, lime, and/or red pepper."

Built in the 1740s, the baroque mansion was originally home to Count Anton Grassalkovich. With the creation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the palace was given to the Habsburgs as a gift and was often frequented by Queen Elizabeth, better known as Sisi. During communism the palace fell into ruin and has only recently been partially restored. The first floor's 23 rooms (nearly 1000 sqm.) accommodate the interior exhibition. One of the most striking features of the Empress Elisabeth Exhibition is its historical accuracy. Besides a tour of the royal apartments, there are also the Baroque theater and the royal chapel. Concerts are also frequently held here. - The visitor service units are situated on the ground floor: cloak-room, ticket office, tourist information centre, toilets (also for the disabled), payphone. - Audioguides are available (hungarian, english, french, german, italian, spanish, russian, chinese, japanese, slovak, romanian, polish)"
"Buffalo/Elmwood Village | eat | Sato | the Elmwood Village, Sato, Japanese, 2012, Satomi Smith, Grand Island's, Serene Gardens'', Japan, Ramen, Japanese, Sato, tsukemono, Buffalo, Nickel City Cheese Shop'', Sato","Operating at the storefront in the heart of the Elmwood Village that was previously home to '''O3 Café''', Sato is an upscale Japanese eatery that fills a hole in the local dining scene left when '''No Noo''' down the street closed in 2012: eschewing for the most part the well-trodden sushi and ''teppanyaki'' territory covered by other area restaurants, the menu curated by owner and chef Satomi Smith (former owner of Grand Island's sadly missed '''Serene Gardens''' restaurant) echoes what's served late into the night at inexpensive noodle shops in Japan's endless concrete jungles — boosted upscale a few notches with prices adjusted accordingly, yet fundamentally authentic and undeniably delicious. Ramen is the name of the game here, and among the respectable selection on offer is the aptly named signature dish ""Sato Ramen"", which places fresh, homemade noodles, ''chashu'' pork, bean sprouts, scallions, bamboo shoots and kimchi in a scratch-made broth of pork and chicken; another ramen selection adds miso paste to the same broth for those who like it spicier. Despite the popularity of the ramen bowls and other full-sized mains like Japanese curries and even steak and seafood selections, the bulk of Sato's menu is given over to tapas-sized small plates perfect for larger groups who like to mix and match. Fans of spicy pickles will be pleased with the appetizers, whether it be homemade ''tsukemono'' or a creatively conceived kimchi sampler with cabbage, bok choy, and shredded daikon and carrots; also, the ''buta no kakuni'' (braised pork belly) is melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and the ''korokke'' makes use of gruyère cheese sourced from Buffalo's own '''Nickel City Cheese Shop'''. The food is unrelentingly delicious, service doesn't miss a beat, and the decor is sleek and stylish, with low lighting and soft music making for a relaxing experience. Best of all, Sato's hip bar is quickly becoming the place to go for Buffalo sake lovers."

Very few people are buried here, so it's more of a memorial garden and museum but the acreage is beautiful and large, akin to Luxun Park. The temple grounds became a ""cemetery"" because, during the civil war, Koumintang troops executed Communists on these grounds and the cemetery, poetry, fountains, steles, and sculptures commemorate those who were shot. The cemetery is an interesting example of Socialist Realist landscaping, but the peach blossoms - for which the temple's garden were famous - are still there, and attract many visitors when they flower in Spring. Longhua Cemetery and Temple are located not in but several kilometers south of the Former French Concession, about a half hour walk or a ¥20 taxi ride from Xujiahui."

From her former career as a photo restorer, Connie has brought to bear dedication, patience, and an unwavering eye for detail to this new venture which began in the family basement before growing into a storefront in suburban Williamsville in 2012, and from there to its current location four years later — with end results that are a cut above what you'll find elsewhere. The interior of Abino Mills is perfect for browsing — the hardwood floors, dark-toned walls, and warm lighting (brought to you by Buffalo's own '''Litelab''', best-known for designing the light-up dance floor in the movie ''Saturday Night Fever'') really draw shoppers' eyes to the merchandise on the shelves. Speaking of, the selection here consists of a wide variety of bowls, vases, wine glasses, decanters, and the like, crafted in the finest Riedel and Darlington crystalware whose etchings often reflect a Buffalo theme — the kind of upscale, intimate shopping experience that brings to mind the Delaware Avenue of old. If none of that is to your liking, you can work with Abino Mills' staff to create your very own designs."

With the rapid expansion of Kraainem in the first half of the 20th century, the cemetery around the Saint Pancratius Church lacked the necessary capacity, and the need for a larger cemetery became evident. The area was purchased by the Kraainem municipality in 1933, and it was turned into a cemetery the next year with the construction of 2 service buildings. At the southern entrance of the cemetery, a small area is dedicated to war casualties and veterans. The larger section is reserved for the Jewish community, with was constructed in 1946 and later expanded in 1959. Many graves are victims from the Breendonk concentration camp.

The chateau is surrounded by a wonderful park with ramparts. The largest part of the chateau is occupied by the depository of the State Regional Archives. The foundation of the archives dates back to the year 1602 when a new archive of the Rosenberg house was founded after Petr Vok had to move his family seat from Český Krumlov to Třeboň. A great merit of the establishment of the archives goes to the significant historian and archivist Václav Březan. It is one of the largest chateau complexes in the Czech Republic. Its present shape is a work of Renaissance architects who at the place of a Gothic castle built a palatial seat of the significant Czech house of the Rosenbergs.

The crowd is a good cross section of regulars - the hip, urban crowd, the theater crowd as well as university professionals and students. If you are a food adventurer and not afraid of a little spice -which means a LOT!!- try the Dragon's Eggs they are chicken breast stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese fried and dipped in the insanely hot rasta sauce. Served on a bed of caesar salad. To quell the inferno you may want to order a side of Ranch or blue cheese to dip them in.

The excavations of Armaztsikhe-Bagineti were prepared recently for visitors and posses explanations in English. Archaeological investigations began in 1943 and three main cultures were identified: the oldest finds were dated to the 1st century BC to 2nd century AD, the central findings on the 3rd-5th centuries, and the latest to the 6th century. Consequently Armaztsikhe was destroyed by the Arabs in the 8th century.

"Buffalo/West Side | eat | Hot Mama's Canteen | Grant-Amherst, Valerie Meli, a Civil War, Amherst Street and Military Road, Hilliker, Headstone Heat, Meli, Jeff Davis, Allentown, Nietzsche, Allen Street Hardware","Usually at a restaurant the condiments are little more than an afterthought, but at Hot Mama's Canteen they're the ''raison d'être'': this brand-new dining destination in Grant-Amherst was conceived by co-owner Valerie Meli (the titular ""hot mama"") as a showcase for '''Headstone Heat''' hot sauces, which she owns and whose company headquarters share space with the restaurant in a Civil War-era brick house at the corner of Amherst Street and Military Road that once housed the venerable old '''Hilliker's Pastime''' bar. The menu is short and to the point, and the food on it — described in a recent ''Buffalo Rising'' article as ""comfort food with a twist... familiar, but just different enough for you to think about why you had never thought to do that before"" — consists of simple favorites like homemade sandwiches and burgers, heartier mains such as meatloaf dinners, appetizers such as salads and massive softball-sized arancini, and even breakfast fare, each expertly paired with a fiery Headstone Heat sauce to accentuate the delicious flavors. Also, this place serves the most delectable homemade, hand-cut fries you've ever tasted, and the bar features not only a great selection of beers on tap but also a fully restored vintage shuffleboard table. Meli and co-owner Jeff Davis bring a funky Allentown-type vibe to this place — they're alumni of '''Nietzsche's''' and '''Allen Street Hardware Café''', respectively — for an overall effect that is ""a throwback to the old muscle car and pinup days"", according to one reviewer: friendly, efficient service with a heaping side of charming sass."

A staple of the local cuisine, the Texas hot is similar to the ""Coney Island"" hot dogs found in Detroit: it's a hot dog slathered with thick, spicy meat sauce (hence their other nickname, ""slime dogs""), mustard, and onions. Though plenty of imitators have sprung up in the years since then, local consensus still holds Ladas' original recipe as among the best in Buffalo — they even ship it nationwide to local natives who've moved away. Aside from Texas hots, Seneca also serves delicious fresh-cut French fries (portions are tiny, though; you may want to ask for two orders), milkshakes, and other fast-food fare, as well as breakfast all day. Needless to say, this is a popular place to sober up after a night of South Buffalo bar-hopping. If you're especially hungry, or if you're a family with kids, you might want to take advantage of the ""buy five, get one free"" deal, which has been running at Seneca since 1980. Sadly, local consensus says that this place has gone downhill since the founder's retirement: though they've added a drive-thru window and table service in the dining room, the whole place has a divey ambience, and service can be inattentive and surly. Cash only, but there's an ATM in the dining room."

This family-owned eatery is headed by Ahmed Hamideh, a native of Palestine serving up Jerusalem-style specialties, and the keys to House of Hummus' greatness are time-tested old-world cooking techniques and flavors that are intricate, well-balanced, and above all, authentic. The menu is not the most extensive in the world, but it covers all the bases: the twin centerpieces are the titular chickpea dip (large platters come topped with tahini, garlic, olive oil, and — optionally — shawarma meat) as well as what the owner describes as ""Western New York's fluffiest falafel"" (the fluffiness is due to the absence of pine nuts, and the indelible aroma of fresh parsley elevates it a cut above what you can get elsewhere in Buffalo). For main courses, chicken and beef shawarma is the most popular item on the menu, marinated overnight in a mix of red wine, vinegar, olive oil, and a secret blend of spices and topped in a delicious house-special sauce; gyro, shish kebabs, and a variety of salads are also on offer. As you might imagine, vegetarians and vegans will find an uncommonly ample range of choices, and if you're not in the mood for Middle Eastern food, they also make a mean Philly cheesesteak.

"Buffalo/Allentown and the Delaware District | see | Paper Moon Gallery | Moon Gallery's, Laura Borneman, Michal Pijanowski, years, Buffalo State College's, the early '90s, April 2016, Franklin Street, Allentown","Paper Moon Gallery's co-owners, Laura Borneman and Michal Pijanowski (the latter an erstwhile local restaurateur best known as former owner of '''Bistro Europa''' who moonlighted for years as a writer and painter before the arts became his primary vocation) first forged their partnership as friends and classmates at Buffalo State College's fine arts department in the early '90s, then reconvened in April 2016 to open their own gallery on Franklin Street at the former home of '''TGW @ 497'''. In contrast with other small Allentown galleries that are dark and shuttered when not hosting an exhibition, the intention behind Paper Moon Gallery is for a vibrant space that brims with activity and creativity on a more than intermittent basis — when topnotch works by a mix of local and nationally-known artists aren't being hosted, then likely it's a community art workshop, kids' class, private art lesson, or some other event."

It is particularly known for its Kelp Forest exhibit, three stories high, filled with several varieties of giant kelp and a wide variety of marine animal species, and also for its million-gallon Open Sea exhibit with large blue fin and yellow fin tunas, mahi-mahis, sharks (including an occasional Great White Shark as a very temporary visitor, before being released back to the ocean), ocean sunfish (mola-molas) and sea turtles. The best exhibits include a large tank of silver sardines that swim around and around above one's head, and one of rescued sea otters deemed unreturnable to the wild and therefore kept at the aquarium. (The Aquarium has rescued and released back to the wild over 500 sea otters.) Feedings of the various tanks are scheduled throughout the day and are fascinating, particularly the Open Sea exhibit feeding at 11AM each morning, and feedings in the Kelp Forest exhibit during which a diver in full dive gear enters the exhibit's water, feeds the fish, and talks to the Aquarium's visitors from inside the exhibit. Quite expensive, but for a good cause (the Aquarium is privately funded, and much of the money goes for conservation research), and most visitors will consider a visit well worth the charge. Hotels sell a 2-for-1 special ticket."

Patrons include lesbians and gays from the coastal islands, visiting urbanites, and cast and crew of whatever film is being shot in Savannah at the time (Demi Moore and Bruce Willis showed up here in happier times).

You pay your admission at the door then wander through the street-level dance bar, trek down to the basement-level video bar for a (less noisy) change of venue, and (if your timing is right) climb one floor above street level for a view of the drag shows.

"Buffalo/West Side | eat | M Asian Halal Foods | 2015, Bazaar, M Asian Halal Foods, Japan, Thailand, Japanese, Asian, Indian, Pakistani, pakora, biryani, nonvegetarian samosas, Asian, Indian, South Indian, Asian","In 2015, the owner of the West Side Bazaar's erstwhile '''Exotic Japanese Crepes''' moved across the corridor from his small freestanding stall to a much larger window in the '''International Kitchen''', and with that expanded space came an expanded menu of delicious food. Thus was the birth of M Asian Halal Foods. The crepes remain — a bit of a misnomer as they don't come from Japan, these thin, crispy pancakes with sweet or savory toppings were invented in Thailand and inscrutably dubbed ""Japanese"", an object lesson in the cross-pollination of Asian culinary traditions — but are now accompanied by a full range of 100% halal Indian and Pakistani specialties. The bulk of the menu is a fairly run-of-the-mill roster of butter chicken, pakora, biryani, vegetarian and nonvegetarian samosas, and tandoori chicken, but M Asian's menu also boasts a few more offbeat items like ''chapli'' (savory patties of Indian-spiced ground chicken that come with a small salad on the side), and South Indian cuisine is represented by a fairly ample selection of ''dosas'' topped with coconut chutney and your choice of vegetarian or goat curry. Food is reliable but not outstanding in quality, but the reasonable prices and service with a smile make M Asian worthwhile."

Helmed by owner Zelalem Gemmeda, an Ethiopian native who's lived in Buffalo since 2006, Abyssinia's menu is divided about evenly between meat-based and vegetarian dishes and populated by all the standard Ethiopian favorites — ''doro watt'', beef and lamb ''tibs'', ''kitfo'', ''alitcha'', and so forth. Also, like its competition, those who can't decide or aren't familiar with the cuisine can order combo platters: either a mixture of meat and vegetarian dishes or all vegetarian, for $9.99 and $8.99 respectively. However, what sets Abyssinia apart is the authenticity of the recipes — complex, nuanced and intoxicating flavors that, unlike many of Buffalo's other Ethiopian restaurants, don't skimp on the spice (this is especially true of the vegetarian dishes). The ''sambusa'' are so good you won't mind that they skimp on the chutney. Recently, Abyssinia's menu has expanded to include pasta with marinara sauce, as well as a few Arabian specialties such as ''foul'' and chicken ''biryani'', available on Sundays and Mondays only. Perhaps this place's only weakness is the ''injera'': they skimp on that too (though you can ask for extra at no charge), and it lacks that slight vinegary tang."

The fortress's first components were  built in 1245 by Count Diether von Katzenelnbogen. Other rulers of the region made their own contributions to the construction castle. It was eventually ruined by members of the French Revolutionary Army when they were invading the area. Despite its partially ruined state, the fortress retains a strong sense of dignity and strength.<br> While visiting Burg Rheinfels it is important to note that the current overall size of the castle is only one fifth of its original size before the destruction of it by the French Army in 1797. One way to understand the former size of the fortress is to explore the underground tunnels built during the 30 Years War. These tunnels were built under the flat, undefended plain to the West of the castle by the garrison of the castle. The tunnels were filled with gunpowder, and in theory, as an approaching enemy army neared the castle by way of the flat plain, the gunpowder would be ignited and eventually explode, sending the enemy army falling to their death. However this secret weapon was never put to use so the tunnels formerly housing gunpowder can be visited today. It is a tight fit and flashlights are needed."

"Yangon | see | Shwedagon Paya | Paya, Myanmar, Singuttara Hill, lotus, Buddhas, Nirvana, Gautama, Buddha, Maitreya, Buddha, the 6th century, 18th century, Burmese, Las Vegas, Myanmar, Shwedagon, Burmese, Burma","The Shwedagon Pagoda or Paya is the single most important religious site in all of Myanmar. The pagoda stands on the top of Singuttara Hill, and, according to legend, that spot has been sacred since the beginning of time, just before our present world was created. At that time, five lotus buds popped up on the hill, each bud signifying the five Buddhas who would appear in the world and guide it to Nirvana. Gautama, the Buddha as we know him, is the fourth of these five (Maitreya, the fifth, will announce the end of the world with his appearance) and, according to the legend, two brothers brought eight hairs of the Buddha to be enshrined in this sacred location, inaugurating the Shwedagon Pagoda. Whatever the truth of the legend, verifiable history records a pagoda at the site since the 6th century CE. Built and rebuilt, gilded and regilded, almost nothing in the pagoda is likely to be old, except whatever is hidden deep inside the stupa. An earthquake (18th century) destroyed the upper half of the pagoda spire and many buildings. Burmese Buddhists are inherently practical people who constantly build and rebuild pagodas for merit.   :The pagoda is an interesting place for tourists. For one, it is lit up Las Vegas-style with multicoloured neon highlighting a galaxy of colours, textures, and shapes. It is also a jungle of spires with superior Myanmar woodcarving embellishment playfully mixed and matched with modern building materials such as corrugated roofing. Unlike other religious sites, it has a spiritual as well as a secular feel about it. Children run up and down singing songs, monks sit on the steps chatting, young men cast amorous glances at women, women stand around gossiping, all while others are deep in prayer in front of whatever shrine has significance for them. The Shwedagon captures the essence of both the informal nature as well as the strong ties that signify the relationship that the Burmese have with their Buddhism. There is no other pagoda like it in Burma and there is no other place like the Shwedagon Pagoda in the world."

"Uji | see | Byōdō-in Temple | Fujiwara Yorimichi, 1053, the Buddha Amida (Amitabha, the Pure Land Faith, several hundred years, Edo, the Phoenix Hall, every 20 minutes, Japanese, Buddha, the early 20th century","The Byōdō-in was built by Fujiwara Yorimichi, the Chief Adviser to the Emperor, in 1053. It was originally a rural villa owned by his father. Yorimichi built the temple in response to the prevalent fear that a dark age was about to dawn, and Buddhism would soon disappear. The main statue of the '''Phoenix Hall''' (鳳凰堂 ''Hōō-dō'') represents the Buddha Amida (Amitabha); many people turned to it for refuge from the present and future, and this gave rise to the Pure Land Faith movement of Buddhism. Battles and fires took their toll on Byōdō-in over several hundred years, but a fire during the Edo period proved devastating. Only the Hōō-dō survived intact, protected by a pond. For a quick preview of what you'll see, check your pockets: the Hōō-dō is the temple on the &yen;10 coin. The entrance fee also covers the temple's museum, which contains a variety of historical artifacts from the temple. The video and displays are all translated into English, so foreign visitors can easily appreciate the museum artifacts. If you choose to enter to the Phoenix Hall, it costs extra, and you can only enter as a tour (aka: you can't just walk in and out on your own). The tours run every 20 minutes and are limited to 50 people. No photos are allowed inside the Hall, and the tour is only in Japanese, although a written English transcript is provided. Inside, you will see the Buddha statue up close. Don't forget to look at the artwork behind you and on the side walls. An interesting fact that you won't hear on the tour is that in the early 20th century, the Byōdō-in was actually used by many local homeless as a temporary home. They tell visitors that all of the fading just happened over time, but you'll notice the artwork is completely gone on the bottom. This is because the homeless who lived here often wrote graffiti on the walls, so the original artwork was lost, even after the homeless were forced out and restoration was attempted.

"Manhattan/Midtown East | see | Empire State Building | 1931, the Empire State Building, New York, many years, New York, the World Trade Center, the Empire State Building, less than eleven years, New York City","A legend from the moment it was finished in 1931, the Empire State Building was easily the tallest building not just in New York, but the entire world for many years before being overtaken by another New York landmark - the twin towers of the World Trade Center. With the destruction of those two buildings, the Empire State Building was once again the tallest building in the city, but that lasted less than eleven years. But even though it's no longer the tallest, it remains iconic and one of the city's biggest tourist attractions. Expect ''long'' lines, and a lot of them - you'll have to wait in line to pass through a security checkpoint, wait in line to get tickets, wait in line for the elevators, and then make your way through the crowd on the outdoor observation deck on the 86th floor. One way to deal with the lines is to buy an express line ticket, which will bring you to the front of any line, but it will more than double the cost of your ticket. Another option is to visit very early in the day or late in the evening, when the lines will be considerably shorter. Despite the long lines and inevitable tourist kitsch, the views are excellent and the experience of being outdoors on top of New York City is a great one. Note that hawkers outside the building may try to tell you there is a very long line inside and that they can get you tickets to cut the line for some exorbitant price; before believing them, go inside and check the actual wait time which is clearly written on the electronic boards."

''The Sun King'' was based on a painting by Gaetano Previati in 1985, a divisionist artist working in Milan. The tapestry shows an imaginary scene of the famous court of the French King, but actually the artist uses this topic in order to create light and golden glares using stringy brush strokes. This type of working of the tapestry underlines the sinuous style of the painting. The lines that go through the tapestry catch our eye creating a scene where the true main characters are not the figures themselves, but rather shadows and lights. ''Still life with fruit'' is by Piero Fornasatti (1913-1988). He surely knew the Tapestry School, as he owned a holiday home in Varenna, on the lake, exactly where the climb to Esino begins. The famous interior decorator and designer, one of whose subjects is the face of a woman in infinite variations reproduced as a graphic texture on plates and ceramic objects, painted a still life theme for this tapestry. Some fruit is apparently displayed at random on the table; indeed the cherries seem to be placed on the surface like notes on a music score. It looks like the real protagonist of the tapestry is the glass vase on the left: it must have been difficult to transpose the transparent effect of the curved surface into tapestry."

You'd be forgiven for thinking the church is older than that, though — the grandeur of the building, done up in the style of a Central Italian villa, truly belongs to an earlier era.

The temple stones were incorporated into the new building, and a number of original Mayan carvings are still visible on the church walls. Construction began in 1561 and was completed in 1599, except for the bell tower, which was finished 200 years later in 1774. The building is rather austere in style, partly due to its Franciscan design, and partly due to looting during the Mexican revolution.<p>:The stations of the cross in the interior on the side naves are particularly noteworthy, as is the painting above a door depicting the baptism of the Mayan ruler of Maní. An additional item of interest on the left side is the so-called ''El Cristo de las Ampollas'' ('The Christ of the Blisters') located in a side chapel.

The most famous sight in Kanazawa, the Garden of Six Attributes is considered one of Japan's Top 3 gardens. Once the outer pleasure gardens of the Maeda Lords, it gradually expanded to take over the entire block. While not completed in its final form until the waning years of the Edo Shogunate, it still represents one of the peaks of Japanese strolling garden design. The way in which water is piped from many kilometres upstream to fill its streams and ponds before going on to fill the castle moats is one of the great engineering feats of the Edo period. In part of the grounds, and with a steep separate ¥700 entrance fee, is the Seisonkaku Villa, build by a Maeda lord for his mother. Only part of it remains today, but is a rare example of existing daimyo palace architecture. The upper floor, with its bright blues and reds, is in distinct contrast to the muted earth tones of Kyoto style. ¥300, and ¥100 for children age 6-17y. 07:00-18:00 daily. During cherry blossom season, entry to the park is free and it's open and lit up until 21:00.

The rose garden was not part of Olmsted's original design for the park, but was instead added to the park in 1912. Although its formality contrasts incongruously with the quiet, curvilinear naturalism of the park's original features, the Rose Garden is nonetheless lovely and renowned, and was recently subjected to a thorough restoration at the hands of the '''Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy'''.

While pedestrians are free to cross the bridge walking, the rised pavements on sides are narrow and you have to share the bridge with vehicles (so always keep on the left side so you can face the incoming traffic); and unfortunate for them, the bridge is easiest to appreciate not from crossing over it, and not from the southern side nearer the town, but ''below'' it, and from the further, northern side, from where you will see a road also accessible by cars arriving right on to the banks of the rushing river (which is in an extreme state of pollution by the time it reaches the legs of the long bridge due to the textile plants many tens of kilometres upstream near Çorlu and Çerkezköy, fully black in colour and far more foamy than could be expected from at least a moderately unpolluted river, but with a noticeable lack of stench at least in colder months), passing along several of the arches that rest on solid earth. Once by the river, you will be below the hump formed by the three taller and larger arches that are over the actual water crossing, and here raise your eyes to see a couple of many flower and animal carvings that ornate the outer sides of the bridge parapets, which are said to be in the exact number of the builders that died in accidents during the construction of the bridge, and commemorating them."

Along with the new name came a new menu that takes the prize as the most authentic in Buffalo: eschewing the Thai fare that sometimes makes up the majority of the menu at other so-called ""Burmese"" restaurants in the area, almost every one of the huge range of tasty specialties served up at Pwint War are made with recipes native to Myanmar, with the sole exception of a superlative ''yum nua'' wherein a touch of sweetness offsets the fire of the chilis and the tang of the lime juice. Also served are what are easily the most authentic Burmese curries to be found in Buffalo (your choice of beef, chicken, pork belly, goat, grilled fish, or fish cakes; opt for a side of white rice for $2 extra), a seemingly endless variety of fried rice and noodle dishes, a Burmese take on ''biryani'' with your choice of meat, as well as a few holdovers from the old Kyel Sein Hein menu such as tomato salad and Shan noodles — and yes, these days you can even get ''le peth thoat'' (pickled tea leaf salad) at the Bazaar! The only unfortunate casualty of the changeover was the dropping of ''mohinga'' from the regular menu, though it still reappears as a daily special from time to time. Prices have gone up a little bit, but so has the quality of the food, and you get the same friendly service as always."

The appetizer section features not only the usual spring rolls and pot stickers, but a slate of to-die-for ''banh mi'' sandwiches. This delicious ambrosia is served up in an ambience that is sleek if not exactly minimalist (it's a much larger and more upscale place than it looks like from the street!) by servers that are friendly and attentive without being intrusive.

"Buffalo/West Side | buy | Lorigo's Meating Place | Lorigo, Italian, Joseph Lorigo, the East Side, Grant Street, 1986, Lorigo, these days, Lorigo, Latino, Goya, Caribbean, Somali, Southeast Asian, peak hours","The cheeky puns are seemingly neverending: Lorigo's ""Meating Place"", so the slogan goes, is ""Your Link to Quality"". Indeed, homemade, family-recipe Italian sausage and meatballs are the specialty at the meat market that Joseph Lorigo founded on the East Side and moved to Grant Street in 1986. Lorigo's began life as a real, old-fashioned butcher shop of the type that are becoming less and less common these days, and the skilled professionals behind the counter still pride themselves in cutting the chicken, pork, veal, and other meats sold here to customers' specifications. However, as time went on, Lorigo's expanded into wholesaling and also converted the store itself into a grocery market that, in a nod to the current melting-pot identity of the neighborhood, sells a wide variety of ethnic foods from Latino (including a full line of Goya products) to Caribbean to Somali to Southeast Asian. The aisles are jumbled and hard to navigate and the place gets crowded at peak hours, but there are some really high-quality products to be found here. Check out their great selection of delicious and reasonably-priced frozen desserts, too."

Its location and area plan was confined to a north-south orientation by ancient communication routes. Unlike other temples, the king had all buildings roofed with yellow glazed tiles and the temple became known as ""Wat Krabueang Khlueap"" or the ""glazed tile temple"". The construction took 2 years and the temple underwent a major renovation in the reign of King Borommakot, who had 3 pairs of door panels decorated with fine mother-of-pearl inlays. One pair of them is currently at Ho Phra Monthian Tham inside the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the second is at Wat Benchamabophit (The Marble Temple), and the third was turned into cabinets and is now exhibited at the Bangkok National Museum."

In addition, the museum is home to precious linen and silk fabrics, books, wooden and bronze vessels, a great many bamboo slips for writing from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220), frescos and so many other items. A 4-meter-tall Mammoth fossil replica is stored in the museum whose remains were excavated from the Yellow River basin in 1973. Aside from the prehistoric presentations, there are also rare animal exhibits, such as pandas, golden monkeys and red -crowned cranes.  The world-famous bronze Galloping Horse's Hoof Stepped on a Flying Swallow, also named as Galloping Horse, is a treasure of Gansu Provincial Museum. Excavated in 1969 in Wuwei County, Gansu Province, the piece depicts a vigorous horse with long tail waving and head perking. Its three hooves are in the air, galloping like lightning. What makes this sculpture amazing is the right back hoof of this galloping horse lands on the back of a small flying bird. The bird turns in surprise to look at the big creature on its back. At the same moment, the horse's head also turns slightly in attempt to know what has happened. The whole statue is honored as the mysterious and rare treasure in the history of Chinese ancient sculpture art."
